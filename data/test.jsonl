Isabella St. James said Holly was like the single white female version of the mansion and tried to manipulate Heff - I believe that to be true. Another gold digger - crash and burn!

Boyfriend told her to get an abortion, gave her money to get an abortion  but then after she does he ditches her and says &#34;maybe I didn't want you to abort our baby&#34; and then she regrets it only because she now thinks of it as something that would have kept them together. But now her life is empty even though she goes off to college to fulfill her dream.<br \/>Her best friend ( Aubrey)knows nothing of this, latter falls in love with boyfriend, he becomes a better person because best friend is a great person and they get married. Girl comes back from law school because her dad was injured. Has an affair with boyfriend, he now wants to leave best friend. Girl says no but knows if she'd had her baby they'd be together (boyfriend grieves over aborted baby though didn't want it until he couldn't have it and obviously would have left her a single mother). Best friend ironically has trouble conceiving, finally does but has discovered the affair. Leaves the boyfriend but eventually goes back because of the baby but knows boyfriend doesn't really love her. Girl never marries, lives solitary existence. Boyfriend is son of a pastor, he and his wife paid for the abortion, once discovered years later, they are ostracized from the community.<br \/>Worst book ever, encouraging black women to just procreate and give up their dreams. Having a baby means you can hang on to your man. Writer should be shunned from literary community. Did she write this with Jerry Falwell?

Nadia wonders if her mom had regrets about getting pregnant at 19 and choosing to quit college and marry Nadia's father. Aubrey is very likable but never deals with her sexual abuse and is just reduced to a jealous wife in this story.<br \/>There is very little character development. The Mothers are the elder women of the church and they partly tell the story in an omniscient fashion but they don't really mother either of these girls, it's just a bad writing ploy to fill in the plot. Nadia and Aubrey are connected in that Nadia's mother kills herself though we never find out why and Aubrey's mother chooses her boyfriend over her daughter that he has been raping for years. Aubrey moves to Oceanside to live with her older sister and becomes involved with this church. But the author unimaginatively has them choose the guy over friendship.<br \/>The reader isn't even allowed to imagine what happens after the fairly abrupt ending. The Mothers let us know that Nadia is alone forever. What a horrible way to end a story. It doesn't have to have a happily ever after but this had nothing other than the idea that there is no redemption for girls who have abortions but life is fine for the guy that got her pregnant and encouraged the abortion.

{"rating":1,"title":"Useless","text":"This book as a whole is poorly done. Its principal fault is that you are simply told what to do, instead of educated what to do. Otherwise the faults are: 1) no diagrams 2) unsatisfactory supporting evidence\/explanations 3) omissions 4) useless factoids 5) mistakes. The only useful part is the bibliography.<br \/><br \/> First of, there are no diagrams in this book! Every aerospace book that I looked at included some kind of diagram about something. The author mentions that he had built models himself, but provides no examples, no designs, etc. This is inexcusable. In the whole book I counted only 4 pictures of model airplanes. The other 14 pictures are of full sized airplanes which didn't show anything useful.<br \/><br \/> Second. He will tell you his opinion and not explain them well. I didn't know much about airfoils when I started to read this book, so to me when Reyes talked about airfoils it was new information. His general recommendation was to use the GA(W)-2 \/ LS(1)-0413 \/ NASA LS(1)-0413 airfoil for the wing because it's popular for general aviation use, and NACA 0012 for the horizontal stabilizer. You're supposed to take his word on this. He then says that at 100,000 Reynolds number (as a hint, indoor models are well below that the rest are about 70k to 200k) or less the NASA LS(1)-0413 airfoil doesn't work so well. Why? I had to find this out in another book. While reading [[ASIN:1619540177 Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators: NAVWEPS 00-80T-80 (FAA Handbooks series)]] I came across a section that explains what happens to an airfoil under high and low Reynolds number. Using NACA 4412 as an example, I could tell from the diagram in the book that at an Re of 9 million the airfoil will develop the highest lift coefficient at an angle of attack of 14 and stall past 15, while at Re of 100000 this will happen at of 8 and 12 AoA. As explained in that book this is because at low Reynolds numbers the flow will become laminar and will not have enough energy to stick to the wing at higher angles of attack. To me this make much more sense than saying that &#34;it will not work as well.&#34; I then compared the Clark-Y airfoil against Reyes recommended airfoil LS(1)-0413 that he favors over the Clark-Y, on airfoiltools dot com. To me at Re of 100000 the Clark-Y actually looks like a better choice. While it might look like that the LS(1)-0413 develops a slightly higher Cl(max) overall at 11 AoA, and stalls at 14, the Clark-Y will reach a lower Cl(max) at 12 AoA - but will stall out at 18 AoA. To me that seems like a better deal. A higher max AoA means more room for control error, gusts, etc. A proper book would have provided way for you to make that decision yourself. I then read [[ASIN:1854862707 Model Aircraft Aerodynamics]] and realized that there is also something called a critical Re number. So an airfoil that does not “work well” below an Re of 100000, what that actually means is that the airflow completely breaks down. The critical Re number is the number you want preferably below the stall, not the number the plane will actually fly at!<br \/> While the book has many formulas, oddly enough he suggests a cryptic method for calculating vertical stabilizer size by cutting out pieces of cardboard based on side body profile and certain wing area size. I get that there is trial an error involved with reading [[ASIN:1854862707 Model Aircraft Aerodynamics]] in respect to dutch roll and spiral stability, but Reyes seems to suggest that it's easy.<br \/> Reyes makes some points on materials, engines, batteries, etc. But In the end I have no idea how any of that goes together.<br \/><br \/> Third. In the end a wing airfoil is just one part of a wing, yet he doesn't talk about wings themselves. His only wing planform is the crescent shape! What about explaining how different wing planforms effect tip stalls, which is included in every aerodynamics book? Rectangular, delta, swept, etc. There is no mention of flaps besides him telling you that they serve no purpose on a slow flying model.<br \/><br \/> Fourth. Some of Reyes book reads like some of the first parts of [[ASIN:1600869114 Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach (Aiaa Education Series)]]. There are countless small factoids and side points included by Reyes that cover full size airplanes that frankly should have been edited out do to the objective of the book. For example both Authors mention Rutans' VariEze, Raymer mentions that that the winglets on the wings presented a novel dual use design in that they serve as both winglets and vertical stabilizer\/rudders, while Reyes mentions that it was the first airplane with winglets. Raymers' point in the context of an airplane design book is interesting, Reyes point in a model design book on the other hand is useless. I expect model specific examples!<br \/><br \/> Fifth. There are many formulas and some tables with calculated values, but when I tried to use Table 6.1. Scale Factors on page 124 it became apparent that the figures provided for weight % are incorrect. Instead I looked through the Bibliography and started a search for the recommended books instead, and in starting to read some those (Simons, etc) I have to say they are miles apart.","images":[],"asin":"0982261322","parent_asin":"0982261322","user_id":"AFXN7W2DMVXRDWSCTQTCHEK6JCYA","timestamp":1441918595000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"length":5223,"length_group":3}

The authors manage to squeeze in several moments to allow the victim to blame herself for the death of her abuser and for everyone to agree that he sure didn't deserve to die because of a little affair. This would have been a great time for the editors to remind the authors that sex with a minor is not an affair, it's a crime. Was it really necessary to include a chapter where the character champions the poetry that her abuser wrote about the abuse he committed as her teacher? It's super gross.<br \/><br \/>I read the entire book, with every chapter I thought, \"surely, this is the part where the criminal childhood sexual abuse issue will be addressed.\" Instead, the book puts a pretty bow on abuse and gives the reader a story about the nearly perfect life of the adult survivor, who turns out just fine. Maybe the authors are unaware that sex with minors is never okay, even if the adult ends up dead.","images":[],"asin":"B07GDDGSM2","parent_asin":"B07GDDGSM2","user_id":"AE5DPKAJSAH5QMCX6SYNANN5YLSA","timestamp":1596994432125,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1747,"length_group":3}
{"rating":1,"title":"Too Many Confusing Words, Names to Interest Reader Unfamiliar With 16th Century Shingon Buddhism","text":"TRIAL ON MOUNT KOYA: A HIRO HATTORI NOVEL (A SHINOBI MYSTERY) is the sixth “Hiro Hattori” mystery, and it definitely does NOT work as a standalone.  As a first-time series reader, I initially thought that the novel was a bad translation from a Japanese original. (It isn’t--the author is a California attorney who has a degree in Asian studies from Tufts University.)<br \/><br \/>The opening chapters have so many unfamiliar foreign words and names (e.g., nyonindo, koya, Myo-in, shinobi, ryu, Iga, and many more), and so much description of special features of Japanese mountain temple interiors and exteriors, I couldn’t find the story that was supposedly there.  The mystery of why two mismatched travellers (a Jesuit priest and a Shinobi assassin) would be traveling together to deliver some sort of life-and-death message, while carrying a cat named “Gato” (seriously!) in a wicker basket, wasn’t enough to sustain my interest.<br \/><br \/>To further complicate matters, this is a historical mystery series--a series which attempts to “remain faithful to Shingon Buddhist architecture, doctrine, life, and practice as it existed on (Mount) Koya during the sixteenth century.”  Lacking a college degree in Asian studies, I cannot offer any opinion on how well the author has succeeded in portraying 16th century Shingon practice in Japan.","images":[],"asin":"1633884155","parent_asin":"1633884155","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1535586313213,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1340,"length_group":3}

I have the other two books and yes I did know that this book has less paintings to follow along to than the other 2 books so that wasn’t an issue for me as it is in the description of how many pages are in the book. However, the quality of paper is very poor. As a beginner I can really see how frustrating this would be for them as you would think you are doing everything right and somehow the paint starts to clump in spots as other reviewers badge said. I came to the reviews to see why this issue was occurring. I do like however as you can be creative and continue painting other things around the animal as if it really was in the jungle. Honestly it’s better and wayyyy cheaper to just follow a YouTube tutorial on how to paint and draw your own animals that way you get the full experience and learning you can. There is nothing special that I see about this book as it doesn’t teach you how to watercolor just gives you step by step instructions with some errors involved in the book.

{"rating":1,"title":"Stuggled not realizing this was a sequel","text":"I saw this gorgeous cover and the synopsis and was really excited to request this book for Fall reading ... sadly I was disappointed and I could not finish it.<br \/><br \/>If you don't know, Art Boss is actually a follow up novel to Piper Perish, another book by this author.  I didn't realize this until I started writing this review and doing some more research, so that may have been the biggest and first flaw. I found the main character to be pretty flat, I didn't really click with her and I didn't feel the need to keep reading about her experiences. I also felt like I was missing a lot of information.<br \/><br \/>Since I had no idea that this was a sequel, I didn't know about Piper or her artwork, so when the author jumps right in talking about art pieces she assumes that I know which ones she is talking about (I am guess that was in the first book), but I had no clue and immediately felt lost. I was thinking that it was being kept secretive for a reason, but then the character starts to reproduce them and then I got more information but the full one never came.  I made it through a quarter of the book before I gave up, between the lack of information that I felt like I needed, and my lack of connection to the main character I just had to put it down.<br \/><br \/>I was also feeling some strong anxiety about what was to come in the plot, and while that is normally a good thing for a book to do, since I was not enthralled with the book itself, I felt like I was riling myself up for nothing.<br \/><br \/>I always feel bad about not finishing a book, but this one just was not for me, maybe if you have read Piper Perish and really enjoyed it this would be a good one for you, either way, I would suggest reading that book first so you have more context if you pick this one up.","images":[],"asin":"1452160376","parent_asin":"1452160376","user_id":"AF4V25WZ4KWQ4N6UCEFHBG6URTJA","timestamp":1543328809231,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1797,"length_group":3}

I read the reviews and thought that since he loves cats and adventure stories this would be perfect for him. However, he gets in trouble at school for using phrases that he picks up that sound violent. This is NOT the book for him. The graphic nature in which the death of the coyote villain is planned and described is not suitable for children, ESPECIALLY not ones that are troubled. The coyote is definitely horrible, but I’m not sure that the way it plays out in the book is the best example for impressionable kiddos. My grandson’s parents have to be so careful as to what they expose him too and this book was such a mistake on my part. Going forward, I’m going to read everything first before I just hand him something based off of Amazon reviews. I may be a lone voice on this book, but if you don’t want to offer your children a smug, know-it-all, obnoxious, and unlikeable role model who takes a vigilante approach to whatever ill is encountered, then this book isn’t for you either.

{"rating":1,"title":"Bright Burning Stars","text":"I’ll read just about any “ballet book” but I was super disappointed with BRIGHT BURNING STARS. There’s a lack of development in everything from the characters to the setting to ballet itself. The summary makes the book sound far more magical and compelling than it is.<br \/><br \/>Marine and Kate have spent most of their lives pursuing a position in the Opera’s corps de ballet; at the end of this school year, only one girl in the class will be chosen. But why do they dance? Marine has musicality and a promise to her dead brother…? Kate’s mother abandoned her and for some reason she took up dance…? I don’t understand. I also don’t understand why, if Kate is so driven to be the chosen girl, she becomes boy crazy and has sex without thinking of the possible consequences. That whole storyline, with the school’s beekeeper??? stepping into help and a lack of reflection or impact… eh. Why go there if you aren’t going to examine it?<br \/><br \/>And the Demigod thing… I find it hard to believe a girl who has spent years working towards a goal would suddenly “fall in love.” I could see wanting to be his partner for rankings advancement, but Kate felt like a kid to me instead of a teenager.<br \/><br \/>BRIGHT BURNING STARS could have taken place anywhere. I never really felt like the book was set in France. Sprinkling some French phrases does not make me think of Paris. And how in the heck did American Kate make it into such a prestigious French school?<br \/><br \/>As for the dancing sections: mentioning the name of a move does not allow me to picture it, or to know how the characters are moving. Sure, I like ballet books, but I don’t know what every single term means. For the longest time, I was confused about the woolen overalls the characters wore, because the author never described them!

A spoiled girl who never gains the character she should have as she ages because she had everything and never fully grew up.

Her biggest problem as an adult is she allowed her daughter’s pierced ear to be wrongly placed . Brooke lacks depth in life and the brains she has is just book smart because there’s not a shred of enlightenment in her being . I find it quite selfish for her mother to condone her 11 year old daughter to not only be filmed entirely nude ( scumbag director and producer as well as  Hollyweird and this country for allowing this ) but also play a whore......and we’re told it is art.  Meanwhile many unknown little girls are raped and killed every day by this particular perversion.  The mother and daughter team are definitely looking out for themselves - that is clear!

{"rating":1,"title":"You are kidding right?","text":"This book proports to be a serious expose of a vast conspiracy involving the space program.  The landings and moonwalks that we watched worldwide were, according to the authors, faked on a very earthbound set.  To backup this claim they offer a vast array of evidence and theories about those involved and the reasons for this deception. Some examples are:<br \/><br \/>The 'evidence':<br \/><br \/>The shadows on the photographs do not line up if there is only one light source, as there would be on the moon.  The authors do not allow for the light reflecting off various surfaces or the fact that while the lunar surfaces are described as flat they are not completely flat, small dips, bumps and slopes exist and would effect the shadows.<br \/><br \/>The Motivation:<br \/><br \/>The Moon program was a means to take public attention from Vietnam (although elsewhere in the book the authors claim that this started during WWII or before).<br \/><br \/>The Consipracy:<br \/><br \/>The conspirators, according to the authors, include all the astronauts, NASA, various members of the government, Department of Defense, the Russian space program, large portions of the British government and astromonical community, movie technicians, and author Arthur C. Clarke to name only a few.  Very little explanation is given to how all these people have been kept quiet all this time.<br \/><br \/>Other clues to this conspiracy are present, according to the authors, in various press releases, interviews, movies, and STAR TREK episodes.  The authors present this evidence in a very unprofessional fashion, they state their points, embellished with many exclaimation points, scatter about boxes with collaborating points decorated with cute little headlines.  This is made even more annoying when some of the 'points' are well known bits of historical fact and the sideboxes contain illrelevancies like British nursery rhymes.<br \/><br \/>The authors find connections between the Apollo program and the clandestine entrance of scientists from Nazi Germany, Roswell and other UFO incidents, crop circles, ley lines, pyramids, Stonehenge, intervention from aliens in the constuction of the solar system and many other unlikely events.  They identify relationships between many mathematical measures but do not take into consideration that many measurements are purely arbitary and by no means universal even among humans much less any other civilizations, and therefore 'relationships' involving miles, hours, days, etc are only concidences and not clues to a higher truth.  By the time I reached the end of this book I was waiting for the authors to include Atlantis, Free Masons, the Knights Templar and perhaps Big Foot.<br \/><br \/>This is to be read for entertainment purposes only.

And shame on me. I should have saved that $.47 for something more meaningful. I should have known better. I remember when Judge Strickland said 'The truth and Ms. Anthony are strangers'. He should have included Baez in that statement. The book is far from believable. In fact, NOTHING about the book is believable. He spent years blaming innocent people of  being the real murderer of Caylee and in the end, decided to whip up a fake drowning story and slap in an accusation of molestation to go along with it. Anyone with a brain cell knows if any of  that had been true, there wouldn't have been a trial in the first place because he would have taken Casey to the police and had her tell the truth instead of sitting in jail for 3 years. As for the molestation accusation against George...well, the entire family is absolutely screwed up but this is very simple. If George had molested Caylee, the 'Mother of the Year' Casey wouldn't have let Caylee alone with him, EVER. After being the murder charges she and Bozo would have filed charges against George but they didn't. Baez says they 'didn't want to open another can of worms'. OK. So instead, they decided to allow a child predator to roam the streets, free to molest again? Please.<br \/><br \/>Don't waste your money.

{"rating":1,"title":"Fatally flawed","text":"This gripping fictional tale is loosely based on the book of Hosea. As evidenced by the hundreds of glowing reviews, it is an immensely popular book among Christian women.  Unfortunately, this author has made some serious theological missteps which are not brought to light in previous reviews.<br \/>1.  She allows the voice of the Spirit (in bold print -- be careful, the voice of Sarah\/Angel's flesh is also in bold on occasion) to contradict the directly inspired Word of God.  The whole premise of the book -- that Michael Hosea is \"led\" by the \"Spirit of God\" to marry an unregenerate woman is preposterous.  God has certainly led many, many godly men and women to marry those with sordid pasts, but AFTER He has performed His redeeming work in their lives.  Numerous scripture passages forbid the marriage of a believer and an unbeliever.  Several other minor points and the climax of the book also violate this principle.  She further pushes her charismatic agenda with dreams and visions as major plot points.<br \/>2. She seems to intimate that the relationship between a believer and Jesus Christ can be compared to a marriage relationship.  That analogy is NEVER used in scripture.  The marriage relationship is always protrayed between God and Israel or Christ and the church.  The individual believer is pictured as Sheep\/Sheperd, Master\/servant, Father\/child, and even Vine\/branch but the marriage relationship is always reserved for the body of Christ(the church) or Israel.<br \/>3.  Her Harlequin romance novel style writing is designed to titillate the flesh.  I would not consider this book appropriate for unmarried young ladies as intimated in some of the previous reviews.  If you are a mom considering this for a teenaged daughter, read the entire book FIRST.  Even though the most graphic scenes are between a man and wife, there is far more detail than most young ladies who are desiring to keep their minds as well as their bodies pure before marriage need to know.<br \/>This book is thought provoking and has some compelling themes, but in my opinion is not worth reading.  You may be able to pick a perfectly good meal out of a restaurant dumpster, but you'll have to go through a lot of disgusting trash to get it.  I would highly recommend biographies of Amy Carmichael's life to see the redeeming love of Christ in action with helpless child prostitutes.

It’s a hide-the-ball mystery, told in chapters that shift viewpoint characters (mostly alternating between sister-and-brother detectives Leah and Finn), and timelines (ongoing investigations and “disappearance” flashbacks).  Interspersed among the mystery\/thriller plot chapters are (1) fictional “case histories” of kidnapping cases supposedly handled by the main-character consultants, and (2) fictional “published professional articles” about the same.<br \/><br \/>I guess that the author knows a lot about real-life kidnap-and-ransom negotiations, and decided to educate readers about the field by incorporating her knowledge into a novel.  However, the case histories and articles don’t add to the plot; and the rather unbelievable plot is thin, boring, and in its own way predictable.<br \/><br \/>Why anyone would choose to present a mystery\/thriller intended for a mass market audience in such a complicated format is beyond me.

{"rating":1,"title":"HLB Reviews Wyoming Rugged","text":"So I picked up this book because I have read Diana Palmer before, I read Lawless and I enjoyed it, so I figured I would enjoy this book as well. This almost never happens to me, but this was a book I legitimately could not finish. I had a hard time with this book right from the beginning, but in general for me I won't declare a book DNF until I make it to at least 10-20%. So I stuck it out for a while with this book, but it did not get any better for me.<br \/><br \/>So my biggest problems with this book was basically the writing style and the way speech patterns of the characters. As for the writing style, the POV just felt weird, and stiff, like as if someone people watching was narrating what was happening, like it was kind of generic with a lot more telling then showing. And the way the characters talk was not believable. In the first chapter is basically starts with Niki, the heroine, going on a bad blind date (or at least your told she's on a bad blind date), who upon dropping her off at her father's house basically tries to rape her. And while that is horrible, it was painful to read, not just because of the subject matter but because of how it written. Ms. Palmer illustrates of vulnerable Niki is by saying, &#34;Even though she wasn't a tiny girl, she was slender, and she had no martial arts skills at all.&#34; Oh and the way the would be rapist announce his intentions was written in a speech pattern I have never heard a college student use, &#34;Girls who date me always give out.&#34; I assume she meant put out, not give out, but its just an illustration of the problem with basically ever piece of dialogue I read.<br \/><br \/>I couldn't finish this book, I wish I could, but it was too hard for me.

{"rating":1,"title":"Terribly self-absorbed, with some interesting anecdotes","text":"Despite being an American from Oklahoma whose highest professional role was a teaching professor in the CSU system, the author imagines herself to not only be fully capable of plunging into the Miskitu War, but of actually having valuable insight to contribute. By her own admission, her Spanish was rusty to the point that she did not understand “mono” (79); she learned no Miskitu (78); she spoke no French (203) even though half of her self-ordained mission was to represent various causes to the UN. Thus, for the entirety of her supposed help for the MIskitu cause, she was unable to communicate with the Miskitu, with the Pacific Nicaraguans, or with most of the international organizations in the region. What a scholar! In addition, the author made many mistakes. She cited Quiche as being “the language of a majority of Mayans”, which is incorrect (117). She slandered Jose Barreiro as a possible CIA agent, which she admitted was wrong in a footnote (128). She described MIguel D’Escoto as a “former priest”, despite the fact that he never stopped being a priest and celebrated Mass with the blessing of Pope Francis (145). She also keeps describing Pacific Nicaraguans as “Latinos” which is an entirely foreign American idea; more accurate would be the native “mestizo” or the regional “ladino” (132). Of course, this is probably due to the fact that for the decade she was in Nicaragua, she had no idea what anybody was saying.<br \/><br \/>Boundless ignorance never diminished the author’s sense of self-importance. Upon hearing some Canadian Natives talking about the Miskitu, “I quickly realized that they did not know much about the situation and had been reading from a report the had received from Nicaragua”, which is the moment she knew her life would change forever (52). She wanted to “try to get the International Indigenous Treaty Council and other North American Native organizations and individuals to rally support for the Miskitu with the revolutionary process and try to help the Sandinista leadership understand indigenous aspirations,” (81). And what prepared her for this work? “I would concentrate on the Miskitia, doing the work I was most prepared for. I felt the study I had done in the mid-1970s on the history of land tenure in New Mexico provided a template for me to analyze the issues of people . . . “ (95). Just to be clear, an Oklahoman thinks that a book she wrote about New Mexico would prepare her for Caribbean Central America, a region she has no personal, official, or academic connection to and where she speaks no relevant language.<br \/><br \/>Of course, she stumbled along throughout this entire journey. She admitted arguing with a Tamil lawyer about the possibility of civil war in Sri Lanka, which she thought was inconceivable; she was proven wrong a year later when that same lawyer became a leading insurgent (168). Her bright idea to prevent the US invasion of Grenada was to go there with a bunch of US citizens; no one agreed with her, and she was proven wrong when the US actually used the presence of US medical personnel as an excuse to invade (172). The Sandinistas restricted access to war zones for foreign reporters. The author “thought this was a mistake, but the Sandinistas argued, rightly as it turns out, that the mainstream US media was easily manipulated by the Reagan administration” (172). The Sandinistas were apparently more savvy than she was, since her interview with “Time” was turned into an anti-Sandinista piece. “How could I be so naive as to trust a Time reporter? I will never again trust my judgment . . . ” (194).  As one critic stated, “She has done more damage to the Miskitu cause - and the Sandinistas - than any other person.” (237). If only she had taken that criticism to heart.<br \/><br \/>At every step of the way, anyone who disagreed with her vision is out to get her. “Is someone in charge of discrediting me at the CIA or the FBI?” (241). On that same page, the author took issue with an article by Penny Lernoux in a magazine called “The Nation”, where Penny, the official Latin America correspondent who focused on liberation theology and was a devout Catholic, was critical of the Sandinistas. The author wrote a 14-page response which she “truly believed that they would publish the full text” (241); she is perplexed when she is asked to resubmit an 800 word letter to the editor because they never explained “why the didn’t give me a full opportunity to reply” (242).<br \/><br \/>The best example of this is with Brian Wilson, the man who laid on a train-track to block US military supplies and lost his legs as a result. “Brian saw himself as one of hundreds of thousands of maimed Nicaraguans . . . Although my wounds were not anywhere close to Brian’s, I felt the same” (253). The upshot is that when Brian Wilson told her to focus on her alcoholism so that she could \"be alert and contribute to the struggle\", she was \"resentful\" because of his \"self-righteousness\" (254). She has the temerity to regard a man who lost both his legs for the cause as \"self-righteous\" because he told her to put down the bottle. “Hope was palpable across Nicaragua, although everyone was war-weary, including me” (257). This is all coming from someone whose sole contribution to the Revolution was to visit as an American and then go to some conferences at the UN. She never fought in the war, she never brought supplies, she never mediated between political figures, she contributed no useful skills to alleviate the physical or mental suffering of Nicaraguans. She never put her life, money, or even career at risk. She sacrificed nothing, contributed nothing, and lost nothing, but is still somehow a victim.<br \/><br \/>The author perpetuates the same sort of colonialist mentality that she criticized with the US, viewing the Miskitu as benighted people whom she can enlighten with her insights. As noted above, the entire premise is that she went to Nicaragua despite having no background, language ability, or practical skills. She described the Miskitu as “brainwashed by US missionaries” (93). She takes a cold view towards both the Catholic and Moravian churches, describing the Moravians in particular as acting “swiftly to bring their Miskitu worshippers into the circle of US influence” (99). According to her, “the king and the Miskitu Kingdom created by the British continued to define modern Miskitu aspirations for self-determination”; however, this was all part of a “colonized mentality” (206). At no point does Roxanne ever ask WHY so many Miskitu supported a kingdom, or were interested in working with the Americans, or distrusted the Sandinistas. At no point does she examine the deep divides within the Sandinistas in the Pacific region, in particular the power struggles between the military generals and the more social\/cultural leaders. Despite Nicaragua being an officially Christian socialist republic for the past 40 years, she does nothing to analyze either Marxism or revolutionary Catholicism in the minds of the populace. In her mind, nobody in Nicaragua has their own ideas, or agenda, or agency - everyone is the pawn of the Moonies or the CIA or is just part of a big misunderstanding, and she is the savior who will bring peace and harmony by raising awareness.<br \/><br \/>In fact, the author speculates that she personally stopped a US invasion of Nicaragua. When she published a paid ad (paid by someone else) about the Miskitu Contras in the NY Times, “I believe this ad could well have been a factor in the Reagan administration’s decision to continue to fight the war through proxies instead of sending US troops” (174).<br \/><br \/>This book is actually a fun read, if you want to read either genuinely intriguing anecdotes from the Contra War, or about delusions of self-importance and grandeur.","images":[],"asin":"0806153849","parent_asin":"0806153849","user_id":"AHTBPY6EI6JIOCLQZFQNQKWTX2FA","timestamp":1578163934235,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":7830,"length_group":3}

Told from the point of view of Ophelia, the reader begins the book with mental illness and death and it does not get any better from there. The time period the book is set in is confusing, or at least it was to me, they speak like it should be Shakespearean, but there is a note about cell phones and jeans, so right of the bat I felt like I was going crazy.<br \/><br \/>On top of being confused about the setting, the relationships all seemed creepy to me, there was a lot of verbal abuse and I also felt like the progression of the tale was leading to sexual abuse as well (maybe not- I didn't make it that far).<br \/><br \/>The beginning of the story was about grief  and depression and that is all that I could feel while reading it. This may be a good thing, that the author creates those intense awful feelings, but for me it made me want to stop listening and move on. I really wanted to enjoy this one too.<br \/><br \/>Received for review from Recorded Books audio and Librarything Early Review program in exchange for an honest review.","images":[],"asin":"1467708879","parent_asin":"1467708879","user_id":"AF4V25WZ4KWQ4N6UCEFHBG6URTJA","timestamp":1396453573000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1425,"length_group":3}
{"rating":1,"title":"Ordinary Citizen Runs Afoul of Government Surveillance","text":"I AM NO ONE: A NOVEL tells the story of an ordinary man (Jeremy) who runs afoul of the ubiquitous present-day U.S. government surveillance of Its own citizens.<br \/><br \/>Returned to the U.S. after spending 10 years in England, Jeremy is teaching German history at New York University. However, something about his data profile captures the interest of his governmental watchers, and sets in motion a series of events that only confuse and puzzle their  oh-so-ordinary subject (Jeremy).  Jeremy is in danger, but doesn't know it, let alone the &#34;why&#34; of it.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, the entire 341-page novel is told in first-person (mostly stream-of-consciousness) narrative.  It's a real slog, because Jeremy IS so ordinary.  The message of the book (I think) is that a world without personal privacy isn't worth living in.<br \/><br \/>In my opinion, that simple message isn't nearly enough to justify such a long book about a nobody.  (You can read the publisher's product page description for a pretty good capsule summary of the actual events in the novel.)  I rate this boring novel at 1 star (&#34;I hate it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1101905859","parent_asin":"1101905859","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1469059696000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1157,"length_group":3}
{"rating":1,"title":"Yuck!","text":"If I could give this zero stars I would!  If anyone regards the last part of this review as containing spoilers, sorry but really you should thank me if it stops you from reading this semi-porn.<br \/><br \/>I have been a fan of Victoria Holt novels since I was in high school.  Usually Ms Holt writes romances that are PG-13 at most, ones that are appropriate for teens or their grandmothers and well written enough to keep everyone in between interested.  Usually the resourceful heroines find themselves in exotic, romantic locales where they meet an intriguing man with a mysterious deep dark problem.  After overcoming numerous obstacles true love triumphs, in a touchingly beautiful scene.  This formula has worked quite well for a couple of dozen novels but this time Holt has really hit a sour note.<br \/><br \/>The novel starts well, according to Holt's usual plan, Kate Collison is the devoted daughter to a talented artist, a painter of miniature portraits, the last in a long line of painters.  He is the last because, in late Victorian times a woman simply cannot be a professional artist.  Kate has inherited the family talent and her adoring father had trained her of the years so when his sight began to fail the two hit on a scheme to pass of Kate's work as his own.  They first tried this on a commission in Normandy for an arrogant and wealthy nobleman, and then things begin to go horribly wrong.<br \/><br \/>Kate is confronted with two young men, the wealthy one and his poor relation.  Both men figure in her life as she becomes a pawn in a power play between the two.  Ultimately one rapes her, the other deserts her.  Years later one comes to her rescue, taking Kate and the son she bore as a result of the rape out of war torn Paris.<br \/><br \/>Rape is not romance, no matter how tortured and mistreated he was as a child, kidnapping and raping a woman takes a character out of the 'romantic hero' category and puts him permanently into the 'villain' one, and the fiance who cannot bear that his innocent love has been sullied is right there with him.<br \/><br \/>Read anything else by Victoria Holt but SKIP THIS ONE.","images":[],"asin":"0754021343","parent_asin":"0754021343","user_id":"AHXWUCTMVBQXDVMDFPA3NO43QF2Q","timestamp":1229558768000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2138,"length_group":3}

{"rating":1,"title":"A different experience than the other reviewers","text":"I honestly had to check several times to make sure the book I had was the same one everyone was reviewing as my experience was so very different.<br \/><br \/>Yes, it has great pictures and really cool info about the breads of many different cultures, but for me that was the end of the books usefulness.<br \/><br \/>I am not a novice baker, I started baking around the age of 10 (I am now 37) and it is, hands down, one of my very favorite things to do. I was rather surprised to find that the very first recipe I tried, added all the wet to the dry ingredients. I typically do it the other way around to moderate the amount of flour. What the heck, I thought, I'll assume the book makers know what they are doing. It was horrid and obviously had way to much flour. I added a bit more wet just to hold it all together and went through the steps to finish it. As I had expected the resultant bread was nasty.<br \/><br \/>At that point I figured I'd just keep out half the flour to moderate this problem. It's easier to add than subtract. Next recipe I made sure to read through the recipe a few times to know what I was doing. Checked to make sure all my ingredients were correct and good. (I bake enough to have what I need and to have fresh ingredients) I wanted to make sure to eliminate user error. I even tried a whole new recipe. Fail. This time I held out half the flour, and once the wet was mixed in I found not only did it not need any more but the flour still seemed high.<br \/><br \/>So I tried again.<br \/><br \/>And again. Different recipes and yet still the same problem. I got one (scottish morning rolls) to turn out close to what I though it should be. It wasn't fantastic, but it was eatable. Today was the final straw. I tried the first recipe I'd tried. Half the flour out, checked my ingredients, reread the recipe several times. They turned out better, but still not really eatable.<br \/><br \/>I've tried to understand the other reviews. A couple seem to have been written without trying the recipes. Not good for beginners? No, it really isn't. I honestly don't believe it's my job to have to try a recipe over and over to get something eatable. The recipe should be close enough to correct that very little tweaking should make it as intended. Sure, most recipes aren't perfect right out of the gate, specially because we all have different tastes, but this is way beyond that. I did some on-line searching for each recipe and found none that matched the massive amounts of flour this book requires.<br \/><br \/>I will not try using this book any more. Beyond that, I am considering not selling or trading it in. I'd love the credit, but I don't want to give someone else the same headache.","images":[],"asin":"068187922X","parent_asin":"068187922X","user_id":"AF4VOOEMVOVPMYCECKREIKMPKPSA","timestamp":1344998913000,"helpful_vote":16,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2708,"length_group":3}
{"rating":1,"title":"Better for historical insights. Not good for children.","text":"Written in the late 1800's, the book &#34;Elsie Dinsmore&#34; offers some fascinating insights into the culture of very wealthy southerners in the post-civil war era. I was interested, for example, when Elise received $50 from her father to buy Christmas presents. That's more than my children in 2014 have to spend. Compare it to the penny Laura received in her Christmas stocking, during this same time period.<br \/><br \/>Parenting has changed dramatically from that time to ours. The moral lessons proposed in this book do not suit a world in which children need to learn to think for themselves and make good decisions at a young age. Modern parenting books in the U.S., for example, urge parents and teachers to offer choices whenever they are possible, even for toddlers, &#34;Do you want broccoli, or do you want peas?&#34; The book does not sync well with the hopes and dreams we have for our children today. My daughters, age 10 and 12, did not relate to the protagonist, so we stopped the book. Elsie would be seen as weak and incapable of making decisions for herself, into ur world. To view the Bible as the sole source of conduct isn't a lesson I want my children to learn, when I want them to be exposed to the beauty of other cultures, other religions, and other value systems. However, if the book is taken in context, it encourages adults to ask questions about parenting, and why we have changed so much as a culture.<br \/><br \/>The severe and narrow views on diet, the religious dogmatism, and even the female etiquette standards are difficult to for Americans of the 21st Century to relate to. In one incident, Elsie is sternly punished for sitting on the floor to help younger children, guests in her own home, to build blocks in her nursery,. Her father thought it undignified. The values offered in this book come from a culture that was not exposed to the outside world or to the observed experimentation of scientific research. And Elsie's relationship with her father, so exclusive and possessive, is not something I would encourage my daughters to seek with any person in their lives: male, female, peer, or elder.<br \/><br \/>I cannot fairly rate this book. For children, it deserves a 1-star. For adults, it deserves a 3-star, or perhaps more for its historical insight. About all I can say for the book is that I enjoyed that the author cares a great deal about her ideas and bringing them out through her characters. She's consistent, and makes her reader feel strongly in reaction to her writing.<br \/><br \/>I bought the book only because the rating was so high here on Amazon. I did not take the time to read the reviews, as you are doing now! My daughters love books like the &#34;Little House&#34; series, &#34;The Five of a Kind Family&#34; series, and &#34;Old Yeller&#34;, for example. And I was excited that maybe I had found a new historical series they would enjoy as much, and something with depth, for my children. Not so.","images":[],"asin":"1598564005","parent_asin":"1598564005","user_id":"AG7IBD4EPP6H3YUNAKJ65VC4X7XA","timestamp":1441379076000,"helpful_vote":12,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2964,"length_group":3}

In 50 short chapters, Swindoll passes on life's secrets to you.<br \/><br \/>Only, Luci Swindoll isn't a mother. And Luci Swindoll is telling you all the things a mother tells her children. None of this is revolutionary. Some of it is even counter productive. I'm not sure Miss Swindoll has much grounds to give anyone life advice. It seems her only qualification is that she has lived. I know this sounds harsh, and it is nothing agianst Miss Swindoll, I'm sure she's a swell woman. I'm just not sure what publisher thought this book was a good idea to publish.<br \/><br \/>Honestly, Luci lost me at number one. It was just bad advice, honestly. Chapter one was \"honor your father and mother\". The advice given might have been great for those that have relatively normal parents and normal circumstances. But it is downright terrible advice for those of you who have abusive, narcissistic, or sociopathic parents. Of course, Miss Swindoll cannot possible know all of our circumstances, but she comes at it from the angle of \"knowing\" someone with a difficult relationship with her horrible mother and he still honored her and she took the verbal abuse to take care of her. I think Miss Swindoll is downright wrong on this one. She claims you don't have to like them, but you should continue to honor and respect them. She doesn't mention abusive, manipulative, controlling parents who make your life miserable. (If you are dealing with parents of this type, try \"Boundaries\" by Cloud and Townsend and ignore Miss Swindoll's advice.<br \/><br \/>Luci goes one to talk about being on time, taking Jesus everywhere, keeping your work, reading your Bible everyday, value what you have, allow yourself to be sad, writing down important things, establishing integrity in your life, thinking before you speak, and so on. None of this is new. None of this is more than any of us have been told all our lives. Honestly, it seems like this book is Luci's baby. She's telling all the motherly advice in book form that she never got to personally share as a mother. I just can't see how this is helpful.<br \/><br \/>I really didn't like this book.

{"rating":1,"title":"Such an annoying and idiotic heroine","text":"You end up drugged, taken to a remote villa, your clothing removed, your jewelry and watch taken and wake up to a strange man who tells you that your freedom depends on the actions of your fiance's father, what would you think?<br \/><br \/>I think there is only one thing to think, that is that your kidnapper bears a grudge for your future father-in-law and that you are the unlucky pawn.  Also, and I can't even believe this has to be stated, but here it is, you have been kidnapped.<br \/><br \/>For some strange reason, Maddie, the heroine of Count Valieri's Prisoner, doesn't get that.  She repeatedly asks her captor if she's free to go, when she can leave (after the already stated action on the side of the future in-law) and if he is going to hold her against her will!<br \/><br \/>I know!  Total mind bender!  Get  it through your silly head, Maddie, you have been KIDNAPPED.  Abducted, shanghaied, snatched, held for ransom, etc., etc.  But for Maddie, the concept seems to be beyond her ability to comprehend and this is where the story hits its first major snag.<br \/><br \/>The second most annoying thing about this book is Jeremy, Maddie's fiance.  He is the worst kind of wimpy, whipped love interest.  He won't even stay the night at her place after they have sex because he's worried what his daddy will think about him.  Also, he's a bad lover and has allowed his stepmother to hijack the wedding.  He never speaks up for Maddie, thinks her career as a journalist is a lame hobby and in pretty much every way possible is unlikable.  I have a hard time understanding or respecting Maddie because she still wants to marry him and then after just a few hours around Andrea (aka Tall, Dark and Kidnapp-y) she's getting hot and bothered over another man, ugh, so flighty.<br \/><br \/>There's the requisite escape attempt, where Maddie has to be rescued from sexily torn clothing, wolves and trees, then they have to share a bed, he sleeps and she spends the whole night thinking about him.  Oddly enough, taking her out of the castle and to the deserted cottage moved the story to a more believable place, but then Maddie started in with her maddeningly inane conversation and my interest faded away again.<br \/><br \/>All in all, I'd give this one a miss.

So, he creepily stalks Meg, even giving her his own name: Sunlight. He stalks Meg, who meets a woman named Sybil. The book is bogged down by pages upon pages of Bible verses being read aloud and discussed. Jared also blathers at the end of each chapter about God and or theology.<br \/><br \/>Look. If you want to tell a story with a message, make it subtle, and trust your readers. Don't insult them by spelling everything out and bashing them over the head with it.<br \/><br \/>The dialog is stilted, the characters are cardboard cutouts, the plot forced and contrived. No one in this book speaks or acts like a human being.<br \/><br \/>It should not be a spoiler, by now, that the end time events (SDA style) happen in this book.

{"rating":1,"title":"Purported “Cultural Study” Reads Like Author’s Memoir","text":"GROWN-UP ANGER:  THE CONNECTED MYSTERIES OF BOB DYLAN, WOODY GUTHRIE, AND THE CALUMET MASSACRE OF 1913 purports to be a “cultural study”, but it’s so personalized--starting with an opening (18-page) chapter about the author’s gut response (at age 13) to Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone”--that it reads like a memoir.  Starting from that remembered response, author Wolff embarks on an epic quest to discover the source of Dylan’s anger, and recounts all the details of his quest in this book.<br \/><br \/>Wolff settles on the anger source as the “1913 Massacre” that Woody Guthrie sang about (because Dylan used Woody’s same melody in “Song to Woody”).  The massacre was a real event, in which 73 children of striking copper miners and 1 adult suffocated in a Calumet, Michigan meeting hall stairwell.  Someone opened the hall doors and yelled ”Fire!” (a false alarm), and then anti-strike men held the exit doors shut from the outside so that none could escape.<br \/><br \/>However, to take this single event, and Guthrie’s song, as the source of the anger expressed by folk singers in the mid1960s (as “have-nots”, against the “haves”) is a stretch, to say the least.  If anything, author Wolff's “revisionist history” shows that you can always find apparent “connections” between things, if you try hard enough.  Wolff tells us (in chapter 1) that his four years spent at Harvard College were wasted on him, and I would agree.","images":[],"asin":"0062451693","parent_asin":"0062451693","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1531508337183,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1425,"length_group":3}

It was not going nearly as badly as he had feared, at least it hadn't until he discovered that his hosts were under the impression that he was the other Professor von Ingelfeld, the one who was a veterinarian, an expert on dachshunds, a breed of dogs that this Dr. von Igelfeld, found particularly annoying.  It is also a breed that will continue to plague the good professor throughout this volume.<br \/><br \/>Fans of McCall Smith's other series (44 SCOTLAND STREET, NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY etc) will possibly be disappointed in this one.  This is an earlier body of work and lacks the overall story arc that even his more episodic series (44 SCOTLAND STREET, CORDUROY STREET) show but are rather more like a group of short stories featuring the same main character.<br \/><br \/>This series, at least in this reader's opinion, is not up to the same level as McCall Smith's other works.  I felt that the main character lacks the charm characters, no matter how otherwise flawed, from his other series display.  Most of the other characters McCall Smith writes about are people that I would like to know, some more than others but none that I would actively avoid.  Dr. Igelfeld though does not show much in the way of redeeming traits.  I particularly found his callous treatment of an innocent animal to be totally reprehensible.  Yes, I realize that this is a work of fiction but I do not find anything amusing about mutilating an animal in order to avoid embarrassment.

{"rating":1,"title":"American Martyrdom Theology","text":"I was really disappointed by the author's lack of definition about the American Dream.<br \/>David speaks in a format to condone everything America has done to Christianity yet, has not fully researched the topic of the early American dream to the present, but presumes his own righteousness in believeing that all of American Christians are \"cultured Athesists\" by definition. He sees Americans as the dirty wealth of the world and that we somehow literally need to give up everything to be a Christian. He makes you believe that by NOT selling all you have, and instead wanting a family with children and a home is somehow selfish, self-centered, and arrogant.<br \/><br \/>David Platt is heavily involved in world missions and his point of view is that all American Christians must be missionaries to the point of martyrdom or, you are not an authentic Christian. He states, and I quote, \"if you think that God called some people to be missionaries, and some are not, you are mistaken. God has called everyone into international missions and to do the great commission and to be a martyr for Christ.<br \/><br \/>I couldn't dissagree more. I believe the Holy Spirit gives urgency and strength to those He appoints to go to world missions. Someone has to work the American dream to support the missions, right??? Didn't people in the New Testament have families and a home? Was that selfish of them, because I didn't see Jesus pointing that out?<br \/>David goes too deep with what is not cross referenced in the Bible and he plainly is on a hate trip with American materialism up to having running water and needing forgiveness overtones for having electicity. All Christians should be fullfilling the great commission and that includes living the American dream. His definition of the American Dream is materialistic culture but, this is not always the case. Yes, we have nice churches to go to but, not all are self-centered, money swindling churches! In fact, America and her Christian churches give more money to other countries than any other countries in the world in light of the predominately Christian heritage. I think he's absurd in his preaching and far fetched. If you truly read the Bible, you will see through his misleading guilt for being American, living in capitalism, and demoralizing those who choose to stay here and support missions financially. Not every American Christian is materialistic nor, called to be an international missionary martyr. In my opinion, he sounds more like a liberal socialist on the edge of hating America.<br \/><br \/>The guilt he preaches about of being born in America does not come from God. Actually being in America serves as a different way of ministering and being a missionary right within our own country! He never talks about this. He only states one side of the coin.<br \/><br \/>I am a very devout Christian, and I would not pay a penny to hear someone preach the words he is saying to people. Our sacrifices to God is an individual calling, not a gross number of people all doing the same thing. God works in mysterious ways. Perhaps you are leaving mission seeds at work by the Holy Spirit and don't even know it. Who is this author to presume he knows what's more righteous for some in the name of God? David thinks that when you say things like this, you are \"chickening out\" on doing missions and being mislead spiritually. I think he truly is mislead! The American dream is different for eveyone who lives it, and those who do missions in other countries, or someone who works in a hospital to help people, that American dream is between that person and God, not David Platt!","images":[],"asin":"1596449381","parent_asin":"1596449381","user_id":"AF7AXYWRX5W5SVDOKDRDIVVN2TAA","timestamp":1308369866000,"helpful_vote":64,"verified_purchase":true,"length":3637,"length_group":3}
{"rating":1,"title":"OMG, want to confirm your own jealous opinion?","text":"I love my local library, which buys a lot of modern biographies for the gossip-mongers in my town, bless their hearts.  So I waited patiently - and then my neighbor, who gobbled it down in 2 days, loaned it to me b4 it was due back.  What a load of dung.  Seriously, with all the author's supposed 'research' it's just a rehashing of the hateful branch of the British press.  No racism, huh?  Can't imagine Harry as a man with his own mind, huh?  The golden William\/Kate couple?  The evil manipulative American trope.  The evil woman who leads a weak man astray was Wallis Simpson, dears.  And thank God for that - King Edward was a Nazi sympathizer and is credited with passing on Allied plans to the Germans that allowed them to wipe France off the map in weeks.  This American is referred to as a no-talent b#$%^ thanks to no research deeper than every unhappy-about-her-crummy-life woman's jealousy.  SOMEONE - likely His Present Majesty, although William is the next best candidate, did express concerns about Archie's color.  And maligning a man who's actually been in combat?  Lower than low.<br \/>I'm SO glad that my library bought this tripe so all of us in my town can read it for free and not be tempted by the 'solidly researched.'  What it is, is cleverly created to trigger the same visceral jealous tear-her-down that has plagued women from the dawn of mass media.  Packs of hounds howling for a chance to tear down the person who has what you wish you had.  The reason you don't have it is the structural misogyny of American and British culture, creating an economy that doesn't work for anyone who's not white male, rich by birth or marriage and just plain lucky.  The current season of The Crown is veering right-wing as well, trashing Diana and presenting a conniving woman who is poised to be crowned queen next year as the True Love, not the woman who betrayed her own marriage and busted up Charles'.  That in-your-face, unrepentant for 20 years actual long-term strategist is the Madonna in this man's hands.<br \/><br \/>Read really-researched biographies by actual professional historians who have to have their work peer-reviewed, whose any veer to sensational, racist, sexist tropes gets red-penciled as it deserves.

{"rating":1,"title":"For Game Use Only","text":"Initially, I was wowed by the  loss, colors, silver edging to the cards...super fancy. Then I saw that the major arcana, as well as each suit had their own card color. Hmmm. I know that in Tarot, there is the idea that the cards are unknown while shuffling by both the cartomancer and the querent. I think that separating the suits and arcana by color is not a good idea.<br \/>After I got over the first impression of the glitter, I realized that the cards did not contain Angels, but beasts and other aspects of the realm of faerie, or fay. I feel that Angels are not of this realm, and mixing the two was a bit distasteful to me. The art was wonderful, but if I am buying and angel deck, I want to see angels. It is the equivalent of purchasing a deck of rainforest animals and seeing Serengeti Plains animals. Just not what you purchased.<br \/>As a tarot card reader, I use Thoth, Rider-Waite, Hermetic, and Lenormand, which is the most difficult for me. With each, I have original artwork decks. This deck has the key words for \"definitions\" of the card at the top, and a situational example at the bottom. Yuck. If this is being used as a \"game\", it is great, but for serious tarot reading, I want symbolism, not words that have fixed meanings. This also made me realize that pictures lacked the symbols, so consequently, the cards REQUIRE these definitions. Really disappointing.<br \/>Once I had broken in the deck a bit, I noticed that the \"earth, which is usually pentacles or coins cards, had their color removed by the silver paint. Now these cards have white places where the gloss and cardboard ripped off where the cards were stuck together and were now separated. I am miffed. I have not even attempted a reading, and these are now garbage.<br \/>Card reading is a practice where cards are often gifted, and used cards are rarely used unless the cartomancer was known to the person receiving the cards, and so passed down. Cleansing cards is serious business. Therefore, I am unable to return these and have my conscience clear.<br \/><br \/>So this being said, these deserve a -1 stars, not a 1 star.

{"rating":1,"title":"Sorry but no!","text":"Starts well enough but before long it goes terribly wrong. I find it hard to believe the many positive endorsements regarding this book. Funny once you realize that the book itself does not have one single credible reviewer. Who are these people singing praises to an otherwise mediocre effort? The story itself is convoluted with pieces of information here and pieces of information there. One moment the victims are these outstanding members of the community, the next there are out of control in remote bars in the middle of nowhere, to the point that besides recognizing the awful crime committed by the guilty party one can not help to wonder if they (victims) did not venture too far into no man's land. I think all the confusion starts with the writer of the book who doesn't seem to know how to lay out the information. Chapters one page to two pages long? Little takes here, repeating themselves in an endless cycle, of the same information during the course of almost twenty years with no added facts. I guess it is safe to say that the story line here is more like short takes on the same subject trying to achieve the distinction of being a whole book. The problem as I see it is that once a reader of this type of book reads authors of caliber and authority, Mr. Tom Henderson's weakness become too obvious to the point of no return. Come on! So if according to the amazon reviewers of this book it deserves almost 5 stars, where does that leave the real serious authors of this genre? 10 Stars? Short of all the reviewers being members of the immediate family and wanting to help the career of this writer as an author, it is inconceivable a 5 or even a 4 star rating for this wannabee. Just to upset the high marks, highly undeserved in my opinion due to the lack of aptitude, I chose 1 star even though 2 stars would have been more like it since he did write 389 pages regardless of the quality of the content. 1 Star.","images":[],"asin":"0312936761","parent_asin":"0312936761","user_id":"AHBDCC6PPJ6TDXHQOYIHKDNS3VHQ","timestamp":1275581172000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1934,"length_group":3}
{"rating":1,"title":"Not Worth Time nor Money","text":"I believe this is the first \"biography\" I've ever read obviously written by the subjects of same.  The prose was horrible - \"the rising sun washed over her makeshift yoga garden, while an exotic flock of birds that looked as if they had just had their tails dipped in pots of colourful paints serenaded her\". OMG. Could we possibly try to fool MORE of the public into thinking that Meghan and Harry didn't write this themselves with the help of a PR firm and two enterprising reporters who probably jumped at the chance to participate in such subterfuge. Too bad most people with half a brain will see through this attempt to self-aggrandize.<br \/><br \/>I admit I could not finish this, at least not without taking a break and getting in touch with reality again.  If I had been able to remove the horrible prose, written for someone with an eighth grade education and meant to make them feel \"smart\", I probably could have stomached part of this. Maybe. Probably Not.<br \/><br \/>This book was, for the most part, Harry and Meghan's way of justifying themselves to the world.  Every single move they made from the moment they met is immortalized in a way to make them appear \"right\" and the rest of the world appear to be slightly skewed.  If, as their numerous and quite public statements said, they did not participate in this farce, then they fed the lines to their friends and allowed them, once again, to speak for the Duchess.  My opinion of Harry, allowing his wife to now be his mouthpiece, went so low that I've decided as cute as he was as a kid, he didn't grow up either cute or smart.  His mother, the late Princess Diana knew how to play the press, how to take full advantage of them, something at which Harry and Meghan are failing. One cannot, on one hand, want to \"explain\" oneself constantly, then on the other, complain that they're getting the attention they wanted, except maybe a bit more than they'd planned on.<br \/><br \/>This book is fluff, nothing more.  This tendency to make biographies into \"even the score\" pieces, or as one biographer in Great Britain called the raft of current biographies, beginning with anything written by Princess Diana, a \"vehicle for settling scores\". But even as fluff, this book is just downright embarrassing.  It is obviously authorized by the Duke and Duchess. Why?  Because these people are suing everyone and everyone's cousin for everything.  I've never seen a Royal so quick to head to court and air their dirty laundry as these two have been. So, someone writes an UNAUTHORIZED biography and has more detail in it than could possibly be gotten from third party sources, and they DON'T sue?  Not likely.  In fact, the entire idea that Harry and Meghan would not have been up in arms about some of the details is ridiculous.<br \/><br \/>The people I feel sorry for are Meghan's former assistant. The book doesn't hesitate to make Meghan right and the assistant wrong. Then the night nurse. Then the Queen's dresser who (gasp!!!) handled the tiaras without gloves (and how would the biographers know that if they weren't in the room, or (another gasp!) Meghan TOLD someone to tell them.<br \/><br \/>Sorry, this wasn't worth the money I spent, and it irks me that they just put another \"nominal\" amount into the multi million pound fortune (yea, Meghan, you may want to change that line up a bit - that \"nominal\" sum you are worth?  Trust me, you aren't.).  By 50%, the book had made me feel sorry for Harry for getting caught up in this woman's sphere of influence.  She stated before she ever met him that she was fascinated by royals and wanted to be a princess. She got her wish. Let's hope she doesn't take Harry down with her. This book should help that a lot.","images":[],"asin":"B0854M8RFH","parent_asin":"B0854M8RFH","user_id":"AGJ2MGIBGBA7QV4LK4IXJULDD4IA","timestamp":1597323148844,"helpful_vote":155,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3724,"length_group":3}
{"rating":1,"title":"Conflicted.","text":"I remember reading and enjoying Sister Soulijah’s “Coldest Winter Ever” in the early 2000’s. It was provocative and insightful. She tackled hard topics like drugs, sex abuse, promiscuity, violence and other sins. The story was captivating and moved effortlessly. And that is what I expected from the much awaited sequel (let’s just say loosely a sequel) “Life after Death.” Unfortunately, I’m not sure that is what I got. Here are my thoughts.<br \/><br \/>The book picks up as Winter Santiago is preparing to be released from prison after 15 years. She did time for her man, she has no regrets and anticipates picking up her life exactly where she left off. Remember, she is a ride or die chick, that knows the game and how to play it. She loves fancy clothes, fancy men and chases a fancy, dangerous lifestyle. Her brother-in-law has a deal of a lifetime, a reality show, based on her life. So, it is surprising when the day she is released she is gunned down. She is dead and this is where the story begins. What is to become of Winter at the “last stop before the drop?” Will she regret all the things she has done in her life? Will she find in death the peace she deserved in life? Would you be surprised if I were to tell you that Winter is still as materialistic and self-serving in death, as she is in life? Her main goal is to conquer the underworld (no matter how many chances at redemption) while wearing designer clothes and dangling off the arm of the most powerful man or men around. She’s not interested in her soul. She just wants to be on top!<br \/><br \/>I purchased both the written and audible version of the stories. When I couldn’t read beyond a certain point, I invested more (hoping) that it would get better listening to it while driving in Atlanta traffic. Guess what, even Nia Longs sultry voice didn’t help. I just didn’t like it. There were too many many unresolved storylines that began but never ended. In CWE, Soulijah portrayed Winter as a women truly surviving in an environment that wasn’t challenging. She was loyal, faithful and loved her family. You sympathized with her even though you didn’t agree with her decisions. You still kind of rooted for her. However, in LAD, you don’t care about her at all. You just wanted the story to end. She had no redeeming qualities. I just wanted the book to end and forced myself to finish listening (I had already spent a lot of money). I was invested. Now that it is finally done, I feel like out of the 16 hours of listening all but 20 minutes was worth it. The other 15 hours and 40 minutes was a waste.<br \/><br \/>So in conclusion, I wouldn’t recommend “Life After Death,” but instead suggest you remember the Coldest Winter Ever Winter. She is the one that you want to root for and want to see rise above her circumstances.","images":[],"asin":"B08CQ17D7H","parent_asin":"B08CQ17D7H","user_id":"AEGYU6OM2X66SMZN6AF3TSQ3N5PQ","timestamp":1678402143197,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2802,"length_group":3}
{"rating":1,"title":"I returned my copy for a refund.","text":"I was sorely disappointed by the actual content- the text, the *words* which were supposed to communicate something of the glory and wonder of science to my children.<br \/><br \/>The book had promise- I was impressed with a my first glance in the bookstore. It's beautifully laid out- lovely pictures, interesting sidebars- but once I sat down and tried to read the text, those sidebars were horribly, awfully distracting.  I don't know who chose the formatting, but it's guaranteed to interrupt any chain of thought a reader might have. At least one 'sidebar' interrupted the flow of a passage in midsentence, then the 'sidebar' continued on, taking up two entire pages before returning to the next word in the interrupted sentence!<br \/><br \/>It's like a commercial or a video game- distracting to the utmost. I also thought the writing was choppy, a little bit condescending, and very much designed to foster a sort of vacuous, uninformed arrogance in the student.<br \/><br \/>Ancient history, says a well educated homeschooling father I've read from time to time, should not be taught as 'how the peasants lived back then,' because we really aren't any smarter than those who went before us.  We stand on their shoulders so we have more information at our fingertips, information they discovered, but we are not smarter than they.  It is a natural tendency to think that we are 'it,' that nobody has thought the thoughts we have, figured out the things that we know, and that we have advanced beyond any society before us. This is a superficial understanding at best, and a broad study of history should go a long way toward correcting that. Unfortunately, Hakim's book encourages that attitude.  She does seem to teach science history along the lines of 'how the peasants lived.'<br \/><br \/> At the beginning of her book she hubristically tells her students that when they finish reading her book they will know more than Isaac Newton.  Since he invented Calculus, that's just a bizarre thing to say. She's feeding her readers a false image of what it means to 'know' and what knowledge is, and just who Isaac Newton really was. They will, perhaps, have more facts at their disposal, assuming they remember everything.<br \/><br \/> They will know more history, since much of what is in her book happened after Newton's death. But will they have more knowledge than Isaac Newton? That is highly doubtful, and it does not do students any favors to confuse knowledge with a handy list of data points.","images":[],"asin":"1588341615","parent_asin":"1588341615","user_id":"AH7HAEIPR7PZJSXD3BDJYHVOFDRQ","timestamp":1140768701000,"helpful_vote":92,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2499,"length_group":3}
{"rating":1,"title":"Eons of boredom","text":"I am not sure what the point of this book is, but it was exhausting.  It starts with an interesting mystery of a strange asteroid which suddenly appears in orbit around the earth and the story unfolds with people trying to avert a nuclear war because of the information, they find inside the stone that is from the future. They fail to stop the disaster, and war commences although a few weeks late, which indicates that the stone is from an alternate universe. (Maybe none of the universes in this story our ours.) What they do find are alternate worlds, with staggering technology and strange cultures and politics that are painfully boring to follow. However I stuck to the end of the book as I am a glutton for punishment. I admired the humans who were brave enough to go back to the earth after the destruction to help the inhabitants rebuild but I thought Patricia, who  was supposed to be the savior and heroin, was a selfish self-centered dreamer and a coward to go off looking for an alternate earth where her world  was still in perfect order, hoping her alternate self was dead, and her boyfriend was still alive, so she could slip into her identity and have her life back. Well, fat chance of that happening. I'm glad she didn't find it.<br \/><br \/>It was hard to read, with too many characters. The author approached the act of sex (twice) as something that must be performed once in a while in order for a person to be able to think strait. (That's just insulting.)

{"rating":1,"title":"What the...?!?!","text":"Ummm.  Am I delirious?  What in the name of god happened so that this book was published?  We've got a wacked-out doormat of a woman who falls in love with a truly frightening man who has obsessed over her for twenty five years. He proposes a \"marriage of convenience\" when they run into each other again in their forties after knowing each other briefly in high school. And when I say briefly I mean they spoke possibly four sentences to each other when she turned him down for the prom and he cried like a baby whose toy had been taken away.  He basically rapes her when they get married, and not in a lusty Scarlett and Rhett sort of way, but a cold and humiliating type of way.  All of a sudden she's in love with him (no explanation as to why, except that she's possibly completely insane) and brooding throughout the whole book about their weird, abusive relationship.  Which is so disgusting in any normal human's frame of reference that I had to repeatedly put down the book to wonder at what mental illnesses the author must suffer from to think that this was in any way okay.<br \/><br \/>Unbelievably bad book.

There wasn't really any thinking involved in this one the only big thing that made me think in the whole story was who was impersonating the werewolf on the news.<br \/><br \/>Thee really is nothing else to say about the book. I might read the second in the series but it very doubtful. I would most likely read it just to see that it gets better, I am hoping, just hoping that it gets better.","images":[],"asin":"B005DI6HXS","parent_asin":"B005DI6HXS","user_id":"AGWBADIYIAGJQQDIQXNN7OQBOVTQ","timestamp":1320294922000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":877,"length_group":2}

{"rating":2,"title":"Chasing Dreams....1.5-2 stars","text":"\"Chaser\" is an urban drama, set in Philadelphia, about a drug dealer\/hustler (Kenny) who's always \"chasing\" his next big score. Of course there is the stereotypical girlfriend, Leah, who enjoys the perks of being a hustler's girl (designer clothes, flashy cars, and a mini mansion), but occasionally she has to question his loyalty, faithfulness and love (he hits her every now and then to keep her in line). Regardless, she is ok with the arrangements until she participates in a hair-brain scheme that gets her caught up with the law. Finally realizing how expendable she is to Kenny, she agrees to cooperate with the police to bring Kenny down. In an effort to hide her actual role in his downfall, Leah decides to play along as his all too willing\/eager accomplice. Meanwhile, Kenny is determined to protect his \"empire\" at all costs. Always the schemer, Kenny decides to use Leah to launder his drug money thru a towing business owned by a close friend's (a chaser named Nasir) father. Being an informant for the police, betraying Kenny, falling in love with Nasir, all while trying to guarantee Kenny is none the wiser, proves tricky on more than one occasion for Leah. She must be careful or she won't survive. While totally predictable, the ending wraps up as you would think, Leah getting both her heart's desire and the man of her dream.<br \/><br \/>This was my first Miasha book and it will probably be my last. There was nothing too original about the storyline. It was stereotypical (filled with the \"N\" word) and cookie cutter (in plot and characters). I really didn't like or was invested in any of the characters. Nasir was probably the most redeemable, but even he was flawed. There was a little too much description of Leah's material things, from her clothes to her cars. But what there wasn't enough of was \"substance\". I probably would have appreciated Leah's story more if Miasha had focused more on why she was making the choices that she did.....just mentioning in passing that she was living with her mother and sister who was an alcoholic and thief was not enough to explain why she got with Kenny in the first place besides the obvious, the money that a hustler could give her. So when Leah starts talking about how she didn't know how she lost her independence I did not sympathize. Even after he betrays her...ok, betrays her more than once, receiving a Lamborghini makes everything ok?<br \/><br \/>It should also be noted that I listened to the audio version of this novel. I have to admit that the sound effects made by the reader were a little unsettling. I mean who wants to hear the sound effects of a Leah orally servicing Kenny? It was crude and took away from the semi-story. It was clear what was going on, but the popping of the mouth was a bit much. Either way, I would recommend this story only to those that like drama filled urban novels.

{"rating":2,"title":"Fails to Sell Reader on Bizarre Plot Premise","text":"I liked author Julia Heaberlin’s previous novel, [[ASIN:0804178011 Black-Eyed Susans]], a lot, but didn’t care at all for PAPER GHOSTS: A NOVEL OF SUSPENSE. The basic premise—a young woman locates her sister’s probable killer, who is suffering from dementia, and obtains his release from a care home for a 10-day, 2-person auto trip across Texas, so she can extract his confession—is simply too bizarre and unbelievable.<br \/><br \/>This is a first-person narrative, and if you don’t buy into the premise, then the strange young woman isn’t likeable enough to sustain interest in her curious machinations. She has designed little tests, involving photographs and objects (e.g., a scarf similar to a murder victim’s), that she hopes will reawaken the still-dangerous serial killer’s lost memories.  Their effectiveness is limited by the killer’s unexpected lucidity.  Has he been feigning his dementia?<br \/><br \/>The parts of the narrative that describe the young woman’s sister, the sisters’ relationship, and the Branch Davidian debacle at Waco are poignant and well-done.  However, this doesn’t make up for the incredible plot premise, and the equally incredible, unsatisfying, surprise ending.","images":[],"asin":"080417802X","parent_asin":"080417802X","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1520869096229,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1196,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"I WISH that I had not purchased this book","text":"As an avid beader, I am always looking for inspirational books to prod my creativity along during dry spells.  After reading all of the sterling reviews of this book SHAPED BEADWORK, I was really expecting some lovely eye candy and ideas to spin off of for my personal beadwork.<br \/><br \/>What I got instead was a HUGE disappointment.  The book is rather stark in design.  Everything looks almost utilitarian- extremely geometric and not exciting at all.<br \/><br \/>The book uses ONLY delica beads, mostly in metallic colors for the *metal* effect and there is very little variation of that.  There are some geometric chains, and some sort of gothic looking things, but as a big fan of goth things, none of these thrilled me.  The Delica beads are SO expensive that I found this book not inspiring at all.  In fact, I found myself wanting to toss it aside and rarely look at it again.<br \/><br \/>I am motivated by color, movement, texture and interest when it comes to beadwork.  This book is very boring in that department.  Not only are the bead designs ho hum, but the layout of the book itself is a bit on the austere side for me.  It is okay to look at, so I gave it two stars, but I really won't be looking at it much again after this.  Only a few things mildly appealed to me, but it was not worth the price of the book.<br \/><br \/>If you are looking for lush creativity with color movement and delightful designs, this book is probably not for you.  If you like very angular things with steel cold look to much of it and if you really are turned on by geometric figures and delicas, then this book might just be up your alley.<br \/><br \/>As for me, I really am not that thrilled with this book at all.","images":[],"asin":"1600592775","parent_asin":"1600592775","user_id":"AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA","timestamp":1246310673000,"helpful_vote":19,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1710,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Miserable person, miserable book","text":"Where do I begin? I've greatly enjoyed books such as [[ASIN:1565123522 French Dirt: The Story of a Garden in the South of France]] and have been an avid gardener my entire life (playing in dirt with water? sign me up!) so this book left me cold and unhappy for a number of reasons. The foremost reason being that this guy simply did not get it. At all. Ever. He found zero magic in his garden, a remarkable feat. This book sounded fantastic. It did not turn out to be so.<br \/><br \/>How the author has made a living writing professionally is beyond me. Any skill he may have is virtually absent from this book. It lurches from one horrible episode to the next, often leaving the reader at a crossroads with zero resolution. His daughter's knee surgery, for instance -- what happened next? Who edited this mess?<br \/><br \/>Another problem I had with the book is that Mr. Howard comes across as FANTASTICALLY unlikeable. Not just what my father used to call \"a drip\" but an actual paragon of an a**h*** -- if the anecdote about abandoning a live chicken in a large department store during Christmas shopping season isn't dreadful enough, wait until you read about his inexcusable behavior at a family wedding. I hate to quit reading a book halfway through but I marvel that I pushed through this pile of manure.<br \/><br \/>As other reviewers have noted, his inept handling of animals is a nightmare. That he never seems to glean a clue from his seemingly endless misadventures makes me question humanity as a whole. His tales of New York City turned my stomach. Raw sewage flowing into the East River? Buildings literally falling apart, revealing the puzzled inhabitants? New York City sounds like a bona fide nightmare. And he most definitely comes across as a native of that environment. His relationship with his wife is bizarre, at best. And these people are fantastically highly paid individuals? Professional jerks? I do not get it at all!<br \/><br \/>Needless to say, the tornado which wipes out his urban garden is a relief, at least to the reader. It's been quite a while since I was so glad to get to the end of a book. I have nothing good to say about this book. His perpetually unplanned misadventures are a nightmare -- does he not have an Internet connection to do some RESEARCH before he throws a credit card at each new unanticipated problem? Where are the raised beds full of lettuce? If his mission was to subsist on what he could grow for a month, that seems ultra-obvious. Add some sprouts and some tomatoes and you're gold. Heck, raise some WHEAT and bake your own bread.<br \/><br \/>I could go on and on. I hated this book. I really did. How you could paint such an unlikeable picture of yourself when you're writing your own book is baffling. How you could turn your backyard into a garden and make so many dumb mistakes is beyond me. This isn't entertaining or funny, it's pathetically sad and semi-tragic. I was looking forward to this book and I was tremendously disappointed. It's not every day that a book summons up these kind of emotions. Frustrating and maddening. I hope I never read another word written by this dolt.","images":[],"asin":"1416585168","parent_asin":"1416585168","user_id":"AE2ODZ4VYQ5FNNCONSHSNZM7PHSQ","timestamp":1294766418000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3146,"length_group":3}

They're all fairly well messed up, self absorbed, neurotic or otherwise damaged. Even the kids are annoying especially the one who wrote an entire (overly long!) chapter in a Power Point slide show which mostly discussed her brother's obsession with and the cataloging of rests\/pauses in songs. While these people felt real, I've met several neurotics who matched quite well the quirks of the people in this book I just couldn't care about them.<br \/>Worst of all and one of my major pet peeves the narrative jumps around not only in time (we often have NO idea where in time we are during the story) it also jumps narrative styles. We go from an objective narrator to first person and in one chapter the story is being told TO the reader as if they're one of the characters in the book.

Since, I, too, have lost a child, it's difficult for me to see the \"tribute\" in writing about a personal loss, encasing it in a psychological thriller narrative and saying it was written for the bereaved parents.  Perhaps the reading of this Note colored my understanding and possible enjoyment of the book.<br \/><br \/>Aside from the above, three things drove me nuts.  First, the repetition, second, the obvious parallels Gross draws to the Manson murders (some of us remember that horror all too vividly and, and will find memories very quick to return) and the ending, which leaves the ball of twine purposely left unwound - to be tied up in a future book.<br \/><br \/>How much mileage does Gross plan to get out of this personal tragedy?<br \/><br \/>Gross is a good writer - his characters are believable and well-described; after a sluggish start, the plot moves and pages turn.

{"rating":2,"title":"Disappointing...","text":"I read LaPlante’s “A Circle of Wives” and enjoyed that novel - remembering the plot a number of years later.  So, I had great expectations for her new novel - the title, “Half Moon Bay” caught me right away, and I was hopeful of another good reading experience.  There’s nothing wrong with the setting description - the real Half Moon Bay came alive and brought back memories.  The novel began to derail for me with the characters.<br \/><br \/>I kept reading, hoping to find one I liked, or could find common ground with.  Jane, grieving for a lost daughter, has lost herself in the process. She shows promise in moving to Half Moon Bay in search of a new start.  Her work with nice, likable people in a nursery, as the native plant expert, gave me something to warm up to.  But her choice of new associations left me cold and caused me to suspend belief.  What she was willing to do for these new “friends” in order to bind herself to them, was even more unbelievable.<br \/><br \/>The “new friends”, Edward and Alma, are a curiosity from the first blush.  Handsome and beautiful, sophisticated and rich - what are they doing in Half Moon Bay?  They’re environmentalists, there to protest development of the coast?  From the beginning, they seem out of place, and, why would they choose to befriend Jane?<br \/><br \/>Half Moon Bay becomes ground zero for a serial child killer.  Jane, being the new person in town, who keeps to herself and skulks around the beach in the middle of the night when she can’t sleep, becomes a suspect.  Meanwhile, her shenanigans - some, outright criminal -  with her new “friends” , paint a picture of a woman who has cast aside her two good friends, her values and self-respect for what purpose?  To gain the love of these two strange, unorthodox people?<br \/><br \/>At this point, the novel seems to race to a close leaving many situations dangling.  We are left to assume that the guilty will get what’s coming to them, Jane will emerge scot-free and probably a heroine, a nice guy she worked with may end up a love-interest, the town may give her the self-respect she has totally lost and so on.  I’m not used to having to pull all the threads of a novel together all by myself.  I’d really rather the author do it.<br \/><br \/>I do like the cover.

{"rating":2,"title":"Complicated Mystery\/Thriller With Large Sections Printed in Italics","text":"DON’T BELIEVE IT is a complicated mystery\/thriller with a lot of “chapters” printed entirely in italics--which gives you some idea of what you as the reader are in for.  The basic storyline is that a woman (Grace), who was convicted of murdering her lover on Gros Piton in St. Lucia, Eastern Caribbean, contacts an old friend (Sidney) and asks her to create a TV documentary about the case.  Grace hopes that Sidney will uncover new evidence that will exonerate her and cause her release from prison.<br \/><br \/>Sidney obliges, and the italicized chapters are summaries of the resulting individual TV episodes as they air.  Thus the novel is multi-layered, with retellings of the basic murder events that are nestled inside new accounts of ongoing events (including the public’s reaction to the TV episodes).<br \/><br \/>The plot is twisty, with some unpleasant things in store for the helpful Sydney.  There are many abrupt shifts among characters (e.g., Grace, Sydney, Gus, etc.) and locales (St. Lucia, New York City, rehab hospitals, etc.).<br \/><br \/>In the end, the revelation of the killer’s identity and true motivation, and of why\/how the novel’s various murders were\/are covered up, is unbelievable.  (“Family first” and “blood is thicker than water” are strong motivations, but a good murder mystery needs more.)  The novel ends with a cliffhanger of sorts.<br \/><br \/> As a regular reader of mass market mysteries, I find a novel that is constructed like this one to be too much work to be enjoyable.

(To see what the calendar will look like on your wall, click on the product-page photos to expand them and see the calendar's actual double-page appearance.)<br \/><br \/>The date numbers appear to be mismatched because they are examples of the different  variations that are available for the typeface (e.g., Matrix Bold, Matrix Script Book, Matrix Inline Extra Bold, Matrix Regular, etc.).

Unfortunately, it fails in production.<br \/><br \/>The good:<br \/> -- Introduction is informative (with some issues -- see below).<br \/> -- Designs are printed on one side of the page.<br \/> -- There are over 100 (I counted 111) designs to color with a lot of variety in terms of detail, style, etc.<br \/><br \/>The not so good:<br \/> -- Introduction is in black and white -- no color -- so all the discussion of color is sort of pointless.<br \/> -- In the section of the introduction on &#34;Felt-Tip Markers,&#34; no distinction is made between alcohol-based markers and water-based markers.  In fact, the technique they suggest for &#34;painting&#34; with markers (drawing with the marker on a saucer, then using a damp paint brush to pick up the color and paint with it) will work only with water-based markers (like Tombow DualTips or Crayola SuperTips), NOT alcohol-based markers (like BIC Mark-Its or Sharpies, for example).  Given that beginners may or may not know the difference, the author missed a great opportunity here.<br \/> -- There's a brief mention of &#34;shading,&#34; but no examples to show what it looks like (and without color, it would be difficult to show anyway).<br \/> -- The paper used is not good quality, certainly not as good as even some of the more inexpensive coloring books (Dover, for example).

{"rating":2,"title":"Political Persuasion Minus Depth Plus Weak Editing Equals Dissapointment","text":"Politics In Compassion: The Future of American Politics is a political book about the present need for political change and why, in the author's view, we need government involvement to solve most of society's ills. This book emphasizes the need for political compassion and it takes the stand that government intervention is critical to ending discrimination, taking care of the elderly, and solving many of America's social problems.<br \/><br \/>This book basically presents an argument in favor of relying on government as the most practical means to an important end: The reduction of poverty and the prevention of problems involving troubled youth, needy elderly, uninsured citizens with no access to health care, etc. This book takes the stand that government needs to act as the catalyst for change by passing legislation that addresses extreme poverty, guarantees health care for all, etc., thereby raising disadvantaged individuals out of their economic slump and improving their lives in the future.<br \/><br \/>This book is certainly passionate about the subject of compassion and it attempts to offer persuasive arguments in favor of its premise. The author is very respectful of the reader when he talks about the need for more government intervention in the economic lives of Americans, and I respect him back for his polite writing style. But I can't say I agree with much of what he says. His proposals for improving the quality of life through government intervention have not fared well in very many countries and it has been shown over and over again that a free enterprise system is the best way to accumulate wealth. But the main problems I have with this book are not necessarily my disagreements in principle. My issues are the books brief length and limited time spent trying to present and build a case, along with the book's somewhat sloppy presentation. My first issue is the one that will matter most to those who read the book. This book is, after all, a work of political persuasion at its core, but the chapters are too brief for the author to have a chance to develop his arguments. The book is too brief to examine different problems thoroughly and it doesn't present a well- reasoned argument that would convince the reader to accept the author's point of view.<br \/><br \/>Like I said before, I like that the author wrote this book in a respectful, non- confrontational way, but the lack of sufficient editing annoyed me all the way through. For one example, readers will quickly notice that one chapter, chapter 3, doesn't have a title while the others do have a title. For another example, simply turn to many of the book's pages and you will see strikethroughs (incorrect words that need to be omitted and show a line through the middle of the word, but were never deleted), run- on sentences, bad grammar, misspellings, etc. I am a little surprised that this book went to press in this condition. The author and the publisher should have noticed these mistakes and corrected them before the book was ever sent to the print.<br \/><br \/>Compassion is certainly a great idea in concept and few among us would argue that more compassion toward fellow humans isn't something in which we should strive to achieve. But this book is a weak effort that has a few good discussion points, but is far too brief and too sloppy in its presentation to recommend. I don't agree with the book's core premise, but the main problem I have with this book isn't its stance; it's the fact that it isn't fully developed and thus does not convince me to consider the author's point of view. This, along with the littering of the book with bad grammar and other editing mistakes, makes this a book to avoid.","images":[],"asin":"1432729098","parent_asin":"1432729098","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1236117618000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3717,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Historical fiction that loses its way.","text":"In the last two years I’ve become interested in the years between the World Wars - fiction and nonfiction, especially the Weimar Republic era. The setting, a rural area and not being in Berlin, made me eager to read this book.<br \/><br \/>First the good: I really liked Fallada’s writing style - rapid-fire storytelling, often driven by quick and energetic dialog that forced me to concentrate to “keep up.” I liked that. The descriptions of the town, its people and their relationships and conflicts were also well-written and engaging. I have a few other Fallada novels on my list, and I will give them a read.<br \/><br \/>The not-so-good: The first 50% of the book was tight and exciting, with a good building of the coming conflict within the town. But the almost overwhelming number of main and secondary characters (the Dramatis Personae did help!), and the many sub-plots and little intrigues got to be a bit much during the book’s second half. And the conclusion - after so much conniving, chicanery and double-crossing  within the community - was a bit of a fizzle, flat and disappointing. At almost 600 pages, it seemed bloated, and maybe 100-150 pages too long.","images":[],"asin":"B00R3L75SE","parent_asin":"B00R3L75SE","user_id":"AGETQ3QIV3CI2O5DQR4RNBTXJQEQ","timestamp":1533504228896,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1170,"length_group":3}

Maybe a 2.5!","text":"Arcane society Librarian\/Ex-Butler Grace Renquist has been asked (by Fallen Jones and J&J), to go to Hawaii and identify an evildoer by his \"aura\". Luther Malone, a recovering J&J Agent and bodyguard, has been asked to accompany her and protect her at all costs. Battling their individual demons (Grace can kill with her touch when pushed into a corner, while Luther was shot during his last mission leaving him dependant on a cane), this paranormal couple, who are drawn to each other and into the mystery of an organization known as Nightshade, find themselves in the middle of a mystery when suddenly the person they identify dies under mysterious circumstances. Soon they are in over their heads into a conspiracy that involves a psychic enhancing drug; a kind of corporate take over; drug addicted psychics with heightened paranormal talents; a siren (LaSirene) who is slightly unbalanced and can kill with her voice, and a family of assassins.<br \/><br \/>Lately, I am beginning to find Krentz novels a bit disjointed and unfortunately that is why I rated this book a 2, maybe a 2.5. Most times, Krentz assumes the reader is familiar with the storyline and doesn't explain certain things. Also, she never departs from the same cookie-cutter concept that she uses in all her novels. Meaning, you usually have somewhat attractive women (with enchanting eyes, leather coats and boots, or a great hair cut), with psychic powers, who meet a J&J operative\/agent and falls into bed and in love with him after just a few days. Oh yeah, I forgot, usually these women have had few sexual experiences, and the man finds himself bonded or fiercely protective of them almost immediately. I just would like Krentz to come up with something that makes my mouth water. Each of her Arcane novels seems to end abruptly with no resolution, and to be honest we need something new and creative. For example, I would like to see Fallen Jones fall in love and finally learn who is at the helm of the Nightshade organization. Hopefully, future novels will be better.","images":[],"asin":"0749909013","parent_asin":"0749909013","user_id":"AEGYU6OM2X66SMZN6AF3TSQ3N5PQ","timestamp":1252590173000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2047,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Chronicles 20-Year-Long Murder Investigation That Basically Ends Nowhere","text":"UNDER THE MIDNIGHT SUN is an extremely long (554 pages), slow-moving, literary mystery novel.  It's well-written, but it chronicles a 20-year-long murder investigation that basically ends nowhere.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, a detective (Sasagaki) is called to a murder scene--a child has discovered the body of a pawnshop owner, stabbed to death, on an old sofa in an abandoned 7-story building.  The detective's initial investigation turns up information about the victim's final activities--including his withdrawing an extremely large sum of cash from a secret bank account.<br \/><br \/>There are likely suspects (a young, attractive wife; a young male pawnshop manager; a probable mistress), but the case turns out to be a regular &#34;whodunit&#34;.  The bulk of the novel deals with the detective's continuing efforts to solve the case, and with the ongoing, intertwined lives of the victim's withdrawn 10-year-old son (Ryo), and the victim's mistress' precocious pre-teen daughter (Yukiho).<br \/><br \/>What really annoys me about this novel, is that 10 pages from the end, the detective has a &#34;eureka moment&#34;--and then figures out the solution to the whole complex crime over the following 5 leisurely pages.  If this is a crime that can be explained in so few pages, then why has it taken the detective 20 years to solve it?  And why have I been reading about his efforts for the last 400-plus pages?<br \/><br \/>Because my overall impression of UNDER THE MIDNIGHT SUN is that it's a waste of precious reading-for-entertainment time, I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"125010579X","parent_asin":"125010579X","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1479154366000,"helpful_vote":9,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1624,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"This one will definitely be my last one","text":"I have always tried very hard to not say \"never again\", but this time I feel I am forced to by the story.<br \/><br \/>Honestly, this plot is just.... annoying?  Yeah, I guess annoying works.  We now have another child in the Colleck line.  Yes the mad scientists who refused to join the hall are back and just as maniacally dumb as the last time they embarrassed all writers with how badly they reflected on R.J.'s skill as a writer.  This time its Charles, and not only is he just as annoying as Davis, he once again can't comprehend how supers work in the Cape High Universe.<br \/><br \/>I'll be honest, this has always been a bit of a red flag for me, but this time its just too much.  From book 2 one of the mottos of the Hall Supers has been \"Photo op more than Black Op\".  We heard in one of the early books that Panther actually got annoyed when visited by less than competent heroes who could not escape his \"inescapable\" traps in a short enough time.  We had Max and Trent planning out their fights because its all for show.<br \/><br \/>Heck in the previous book Tank openly tells one \"mundane\" that the fight they are about to witness should be costing the location thousands of dollars in appearance fees to get the Supers to fight at that location.<br \/><br \/>Why?  How many people wouldn't ahve figured out the truth after Herold's antics.  Heck it seems that Charles has lived under a rock for the entirety of the series.  He did not know that his father \"The Collector\" who is in a coma since book 3, ended up in that coma after the rescue of the \"zoo kids\".  This is such an open secret in the hero world that I can't imagine any super not knowing.  Heck I expect that at least 70-80% of the mundanes have heard about it.  (Yes, Nico does try to limit who films him, but does anyone really believe that it wouldn't be widely talked about on the internet and the news.  I'm sure the mundane news includes talk of super sightings and actions.)<br \/><br \/>But that's always been my major issue with all of this.  R.J. does craft fascinating scenes and fun stories, but they have always been empty.  I mentioned in one of my other reviews of this series that the romances are extremely G rated with never a mention of any of the teen characters getting caught \"in flagrante\".  Heck, the closest we've had to a \"love triangle\" was Ace and Justin both being interested in Morgan (and neither ever doing anything with Justin eventually dating Malina for a short time).<br \/><br \/>I just don't see enough continuity of character or of plot to want to continue.  It's not even like a comic book as those try to focus on just a few characters for a time before adding\/subtracting\/switching up character.  Here its every book jumps around with a few themed characters who are always around.  But that is no longer what I want, or what I think this series needs.<br \/><br \/>Sadly, as I said, Kitty's Pride is the end of the road for me.  I just can't keep reading stories that had such a poor payout for the time spent.","images":[],"asin":"B08VR7S6KF","parent_asin":"B08VR7S6KF","user_id":"AE747CPTU3RCQNGPY4OYSSKJHKQQ","timestamp":1613443135926,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":true,"length":3020,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"HLB Reviews Close to Home","text":"I don't know about you guys but I love books about a guy in uniform, and I was really drawn to the blurb on this book. I liked that this guy was coming off of a long term undercover assignment only to find out that his wife had left him while he was gone. Yes it sucks, but I liked that the whole book was going to be about him trying to fix his marriage, what can I say, I like people who work for it.<br \/><br \/>So when the book starts I was pretty for a chapter or two. I liked Johnny, or rather I kind of liked where his story started. His assignment has just ended, it seems like it went really well and he's getting all these accolades at his job for doing a great job on this long term undercover work. It's clear he wants to get home to see his wife, and then of course the shoe drops. She left him a dear John letter, with divorce papers. I don't know about you guys, but to me it made me kind of hate her right off the bat. I mean I'm sure it's hard to live away from your husband for such a long time, I'm an army wife so I've been there, but to just leave him, move out your home, not leave a forwarding address, and basically just take off seems all kind of messed up.<br \/><br \/>Of course Johnny goes to track her down and try to fix whatever is wrong with his marriage, and this is where things went off the rails for me. Apparently these two, Johnny and Tessa, have been married for like almost a decade and apparently have not so much as kissed. It's weird. I get why she left him, he wants to be loved, not have a roommate. And as it turns out Johnny has feelings for her, wants her physically, and loves her, so why weren't they involved? And I'm sorry I know almost no guy who is going to go almost a decade without sex of any kind, so either he was sleeping with other people while they were married, or I dunno, it was just weird to me. I had a hard time getting on board with the whole premise of this couple. There is some backstory to explain things, but it still didn't work for me.<br \/><br \/>Also another huge problem I had was the writing style. The POV kind of jumped around without much warning which was kind of off putting. But more than that, for me, was the I guess I would call it simplistic writing style. It didn't draw me into the characters or the plot and seemed more like a short and sweet style, sometimes it felt a bit cheesy or not like real people, it just did not work for me. I think if you like the kind of short and sweet romance books, this would probably work for you, but it did not do anything for me.","images":[],"asin":"B01IA6FMFI","parent_asin":"B01IA6FMFI","user_id":"AG3XIAIYKMMG356ZP2UJ4RFQTJJA","timestamp":1487044904000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2555,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Not really my cup of tea!","text":"Kimberly \"Kiki Mimi\" Kind should have it all. She's a successful attorney who is working as an Assistant District Attorney in New York City. She's got looks and she's smart, BUT she's a mess...literally. For starters, Kimberly seems to have a substance abuse problem. She drinks Jameson like she's drinking water and she's popping pain pills like they are candy. The main witness in her high profile case was murdered while she was suppose to be protecting him; her best friend\/roommate is now dating her boyfriend; she ended a recent affair with her boss, the DA; she's still experiencing pain as a result of injuries she suffered in an accident with her best friend; and her antics are likely to cost her her job. And to complicate matters, she just started an affair with her complete opposite, a white tough guy named Rig \"King\" McDonnell, who may very well turn out to be someone far different than she initially thought. And woven throughout all of this is drama is her personal life (i.e., story) that involves an alcoholic father, a sex-addicted twin brother, and a crack-addicted mother. So I guess there's no wonder that she is a mess.<br \/><br \/>Personally, I had high hopes for \"Hold Me in Contempt\". If for no other reason, I thought Wendy Williams would weave a pretty entertaining tale. Anyone who watches her day-time talk-show knows she can tell a story like no one else. HOWEVER, in my humble opinion, she fell short in this story and there really wasn't any excuse for her missing the mark. There was everything present that should have made this a riveting read: danger, suspense and sex, all peppered with a ton of secrets. But to me, none of these things came together into a cohesive and enjoyable read. And there were even portions that seemed forced. And I am not sure which was worse, the erotica, the constant urban lingo (and I really hated her nickname....Kiki MiMi) or the attempt at the end to bring some kind of closure. So read this book with no expectations and at your own risk. That way you won't be disappointed or surprised.  2 stars","images":[],"asin":"0062268414","parent_asin":"0062268414","user_id":"AEGYU6OM2X66SMZN6AF3TSQ3N5PQ","timestamp":1399253488000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2071,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Beautifully Designed Book With Minimal Knitting Content","text":"Author Lucy Main Tweet is a former \"fashion leader\" for Talbots, Evan Picone, J. Crew, and Bernard Chaus; during her professional career, her passion was needlepoint.  When she left the fashion industry in 2008, she accepted her mother's suggestion, and took up knitting.  Thus, by her own admission, she is a \"novice knitter\".  Her lack of knitting experience really shows in KNITOLOGIE: CREATING PERSONAL HEIRLOOM KNITS.<br \/><br \/>As a novice knitter, Tweet got bored with casting on, knitting, purling, and casting off.  So she decided to make a scarf, using these basic skills, that would be personalized with her own initials.  As a result, the bulk of KNITOLOGIE consists of giant knitting stitch grids (not standard knitting charts), with numbered rows, that graph a design for each letter of the alphabet.  In the accompanying photos, the letters are usually made in reverse stockinette on a stockinette background.  (But of course they can be knit in stockinette on a reverse stockinette background; or all in stockinette or reverse stockinette if you use two colors of yarn.)<br \/><br \/>The remainder of the book consists of extremely simple patterns for square pillows, mittens, mitts, rectangular scarves, and baby caps--all of which use one or more letters from the alphabet grids.  Brand-new knitters may find the alphabet and patterns useful, but they will have to look elsewhere for even the most basic how-to-knit instructions.<br \/><br \/>KNITOLOGIE is a beautifully designed book, expensively produced with lovely color photographs.  It even has a ribbon bookmark--with a cardboard \"swatch\" square to weight it down--attached to the inside back cover. (Be careful when you open the book, or the ribbon will tear the book's back endpaper.)  However, the book's production values do not make up for the lack of useful knitting content.<br \/><br \/>When I purchased this book, I expected a book with an assortment of knitted alphabets, possibly accompanied by a text discussing how to design attractive knitted monograms.  (Such a book would be a welcome addition to my knitting book collection.)  However, KNITOLOGIE has only one block-letter alphabet--and that alphabet is one that could be designed by anyone with a pad of graph paper.<br \/><br \/>As a hardcover, coffee-table-sized, 160-page book, KNITOLOGIE is probably priced reasonably at slightly under $22.  But KNITOLOGIE should have been published, if at all, as an inexpensive leaflet or paperback for novice knitters like the author.  Because the book is overproduced (and consequently overpriced considering the actual knitting content), I rate it at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the official Amazon scale).  For now, the Internet is still the best source for knitted alphabets to be used for personalizing your hand-knitted garments and accessories.","images":[],"asin":"0983270244","parent_asin":"0983270244","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1361579409000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2829,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Boring Mystery\/Thriller About Book Publishing, Unscrupulous Media Magnate","text":"Book publishing isn't particularly exciting,  not even when a terrific, controversial manuscript, with \"best seller\" written all over it, arrives on the desk of an agent, editor, publisher, or movie producer.  And that's exactly what's wrong with THE ACCIDENT--a novel about an unpublished manuscript so explosive that even possessing a photocopy of it can get a person killed.  THE ACCIDENT, for most of its 300-plus pages, is just plain boring.<br \/><br \/>The novel is well-written, but always slow-moving.  Worse yet, the author compensates for the lack of action by adding paragraph upon paragraph of description.  After a while the reader tires of the lengthy, Proust-like word pictures--lists of the types of people seen in the crowds of New York City, Paris, and other European cities; detailed inventories of the interiors of slummy flats, showplace offices, singles bars, high-rise apartments, and landed estates in fashionable New York suburbs; painstakingly detailed observations regarding the characters' clothing and possessions.<br \/><br \/>The plot is simplicity itself.  An anonymous author has written an unauthorized biography of a powerful media magnate who is about to run for public office.  If the events related in the biography are true, then publication of the book will not only bring down the magnate's publishing empire, it will also topple many well-connected politicians, judges, policemen, FBI agents, CIA operatives, and so on.<br \/><br \/>Of course, the magnate wields tremendous power, and has truly unbelievable surveillance, tracking, and goon resources.  The magnate--and his connected friends--will stop at nothing to collect and destroy all copies of the manuscript (which exists only as a paper original and photocopies).  Thus every single individual who comes in contact with the manuscript is placed in great peril, and there are many fatalities.<br \/><br \/>All of the \"action\" in THE ACCIDENT happens in a single day--starting from the time that a literary agent finishes reading the manuscript; continuing as legitimate and clandestine copies are made by various people who see the manuscript's money-making potential; and ending with the ultimate fate of the manuscript.<br \/><br \/>Because THE ACCIDENT is tiresome, overloaded with descriptive passages, and has an unbelievable plot, I rate it at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"0385348452","parent_asin":"0385348452","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1400034521000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2398,"length_group":3}

Come up with some new curse words if someone needs to curse at all, for Pete's sake!<br \/><br \/>Laia<br \/>The biggest problem I've had with Laia is her age. I can't remember if it was explicitly mentioned in the first book or not, but she's always seemed like a 12-year-old to me. She acts and sounds like one. So when two grown men want to sleep with her, it throws me for a loop. I had the same problem through the first entire book. I can't reconcile a 17 year old Laia (which is what she's supposed to be, I'm guessing? Or something like that?) with the 11 or 12 year old that I envision.<br \/>Laia's constant bad decisions are just inexplicable. How many people have to die just because she says so? Because she orders people around on what they should or should not do and as a result so many more innocent people die. She makes the situation about her own conscience rather than what is really going on around her with the other people and her terrible decisions lead to disaster after disaster.<br \/>And her personality is grating. She's selfish and nothing particularly special and for the life of me I can't figure out why people respect her much less gravitate toward or love her. The love triangle is downright annoying. Why is there a love triangle at all? The \"attraction\" with Keenan was fake fake fake from the very beginning. He seemed to \"fall\" for Laia after spending ten minutes with her. With Elias it was more reasonable--at least in the first book they spent an entire night talking with each other. But Keenan falling head over heels for a girl he doesn't even know is suspicious from the start--as it should've been when all is revealed--but that doesn't explain Laia's blatant naivete about him. All I could keep thinking was, \"you're seriously falling for this?\" Gag me.<br \/><br \/>Elias<br \/>I like Elias. He was strong in the first book. In this book he's poisoned at the beginning and that's pretty much it for the relevance of his story line. It's really lame and sad.

After this really unsatisfying ending I hope something gets reconciled for him or else he really got shafted.<br \/><br \/>Helene<br \/>Helene's chapters were probably the best, but she gets beat down constantly as well. She can never make the right decision and pays dearly for it. It's a really sad ending for her that is undeserved.<br \/><br \/>The second book was brutally violent (like the first) and you're constantly beat down so severely it makes it difficult to keep reading.<br \/><br \/>Dear Author, YOUR READERS NEED A BREAK.<br \/>It's exhausting reading about defeat after defeat and bad choice after bad choice.

{"rating":2,"title":"I am not sure if I would necessarily recommend that you read it, but.....!","text":"I think the other reviews, and the description of the book is enough to give you an idea about what the book is about, so I will try not to retell. I decided to give the book a chance because I watched an episode of the television series and thought that it would be interesting. Please note that the book does vary from the series. Anyway, I am not sure if I was right about giving this book a chance. I expected it to be more like \"Wolves in Chic Clothing\", but it wasn't. At times it was too wordy and tooooooooo superficial.<br \/><br \/>In a nutshell, Gracie's Hollywood husband tells her that he wants a divorce via cell phone. He has found another love....a la Brittany Spears. He tells Gracie this after almost 10 years of marriage (he breaks the news 1 month before their anniversary) and a four year old daughter.  And she realizes, he drops this news weeks before their pre-nup would be null in void. Anyway, as she goes through several unnecessary changes (for example, the whole I am not accepted in my old world because I was a starter wife and what does this mean?), she is supported by three loyal friends (a gay interior decorator, Will; a dizzy wife of a successful producer, Cricket; and a longtime friend and drunk, Joan).  They soon help her realize that she never really, truly loved Kenny (a loser), and that she had indeed lost herself in the marriage.  She had given up everything, including writing (she wrote children books) to become what he wanted, a Hollywood wife.<br \/><br \/>What I did like about the story was the journey Gracie made realizing that by compromising herself, or giving up small pieces of herself to satisfy her husband's desire for success, she forgot who she was. So, while discovering herself and her independence, she soon finds lust (which for her turns into love) with Sam, who appears on the surface to be a homeless man with a checkered past. I did like the story of how Sam became what he was, and how he decided to rejoin society because of his love for her. HOWEVER, there were several things that I didn't like about the novel. I thought the whole \"ex-husband leaves her for Brittany Spears\" was stupid! And the whole chatter containing the Hollywood inside scoop was dumb. I think the story referencing Gracie and Sam's journeys to find each other and themselves was more compelling than the \"insider\" scoop. With that in mind, a \"2\" is all that I think the book warrants, and that is probably being generous.","images":[],"asin":"0743265033","parent_asin":"0743265033","user_id":"AEGYU6OM2X66SMZN6AF3TSQ3N5PQ","timestamp":1187099909000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2467,"length_group":3}

{"rating":2,"title":"No Heads or Tails","text":"This must be a different type of a book. Even though the author has a lot to say the way she goes about it makes it very hard to follow, much less enjoy. I wanted to read this title because it had mention it was about all kinds of people  of an artistic nature in New York City, something about Anglo Americans and Latin Americans coexisting together. The narrative is, to say the least, choppy and mixed, hard to gather enough interest in any particular situation or character. I imagine the style of writing is not necessarily following the basic story line of people and situations. It is more like enlightened dialogues, plenty of discourse but at the end of the day I found No Head or Tails.<br \/>Certainly for the acquired taste, not a fluent book.<br \/>I have never enjoyed books of this nature for I value story line the most in any style and this book lacks any sense of continuity. Difficult to enjoy unless, perhaps, one is immersed in the world that the author tries to convey. With a desire to understand a little more of inter culture I thought this one would be an interesting book. No dice for me.<br \/>I am thankful I had to chance to read it, even though I can not rightly say I read each page for I found myself frustrated as I went along and must have skipped a few more pages than I am willing to admit. Like I said: perhaps this book is for a segment of the population that understands the linguistic approach and relates to all the aspects of the book. To an avid reader that puts the story line first, regardless, this book did not strike any chords.

I suppose the story was written to tell about these primitive people who had never been &#34;civilized&#34; and the narrator had made this great discovery of a completely &#34;virgin&#34; culture. But the tale takes a rather perverted twist which continues throughout the second half of the book when the narrator brings the natives to live, sealed in his lab, in the USA. It all seems so unlikely and concludes recounting a grotesque and picayoun set of circumstances and seems to forget all about the niave people that were the focus of the study.<br \/>I have read A Little Life: A Novel, and loved the writing and the development of the characters and the delicate and exciting sense of place. The trees book lacked most of that for me. And I never did get much of a sense of Micronesia!","images":[],"asin":"B00BH0VSSA","parent_asin":"B00BH0VSSA","user_id":"AE4RGRZ5J6EJSBU35GHRGZM4ZBUA","timestamp":1493858275000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1157,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Saga of Blindfolded Woman's Struggle to Row Boat to  Sanctuary","text":"***SPOILER ALERT:  There are many, many plot events that are NOT mentioned in this review; however it is necessary to discuss the book's structure, general plot, and some plot elements that are revealed early in the book to be able to write a meaningful review.***<br \/><br \/>BIRD BOX essentially tells the story of a blindfolded woman's struggle to row a boat--a boat carrying herself and two small children--to a riverside sanctuary.  Blindfolds for the woman and children are essential, because there are creatures roaming the riverbanks that cause all humans who see them to go completely mad.<br \/><br \/>Any human who sees a creature--directly or in a videotape--will first attack other humans and then commit suicide.  The creatures are never described, there is no explanation of their origin, and nothing is said about how they survive.  Apparently the creatures do not physically harm humans, because the bodies of humans who die from seeing the creatures are left to rot.<br \/><br \/>In flashback chapters that alternate with the rowboat chapters, the book tells the story of how the woman (Malorie) came to be in her present situation.  When the creatures arrived in her city, she and a few others took refuge in a house, covered the windows with black drapes, and made sure that no creature or already-mad-human entered the house.  Whenever they ventured outdoors for water and supplies, the survivors wore blindfolds.  They rigged a \"bird box\" of caged birds that cooed whenever any creature approached the house.  The survivors also developed mildly complicated relationships within their confined existence.  Probably the most interesting part of the survivors' story is the scene about how the madness finally entered the house and destroyed most of the occupants.<br \/><br \/>In my opinion, the author's failure to create believable, frightening creatures is responsible for causing this entire novel to fail.  More than anything else, BIRD BOX reminds me of the low-budget science fiction movies where the audience \"sees\" invisible threats through the movement of bushes, tree branches, and tall grass.  Although Malorie's bravery in rowing the boat to sanctuary is admirable,  her problem of having to remove the blindfold briefly to find the sanctuary is not frightening enough to sustain the rowboat portions of the novel.  Also, the final ending is guessable, anticlimactic, and not particularly believable.  Because nothing much happens in this book, I rate BIRD BOX at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"0062259652","parent_asin":"0062259652","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1391052850000,"helpful_vote":30,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2548,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"The Worthless Dreams of Canadian Citizens","text":"This long-winded and unconvincing novel begins with an &quot;Author's Note&quot; in which the unnamed narrator informs us that he is an ARTIST, and his fellow-citizens should pay an arts bureaucracy to support him in replacing their &quot;crude reality&quot; and &quot;worthless dreams&quot; with works of his imagination.  I know many Canadians, and am delighted to say that they need a caste of &quot;artists&quot; to provide them with dreams the way a fish needs a bicycle.  As for the story...<br \/>The narrator actually presents us with two stories, neither of which is especially convincing.  In one, a young man and his mother are trapped on a lifeboat with a cannibal cook, the last a survival expert whose amazing knife (it MUST be a Ginsu!) is capable of both dressing meat and chopping off heads.  After the cook has for no particular reason created a raft out of oars and chopped off the mother's head, the plucky lad wrests the cook's knife away and slowly chops him to bits.  The other story is invested with a good deal more versimilitude - up to a point.  In THAT story, the young man must manage a powerful but unpredictable being who can be palliated, but never entirely tamed, through offerings.  However that story also contains blatantly unbelievable nonsense.  &quot;Which story,&quot; we are asked, &quot;Do you prefer?&quot;  Well neither, but I'm an agnostic...<br \/>I found the author's point to be heavy-handed and rather naive.  In addition there is a good deal of misplaced humour in the book - I won't say it isn't amusing, but Mr. Martel might have been better advised to keep the Mutt and Jeff routines and ditch the religious speculation.<br \/>The book does raise one worthwhile question, but I think the book itself is the answer to it.  Should government 'arts' bureaucracies create and support a separate caste of &quot;artists&quot;, or should artists be ordinary citizens, discovering art through participation in real life?  More real life would have helped this book.  Citizens should support, not their artists, but their art.  Those who rely on others' imaginations live worthless lives, and realize crude dreams.","images":[],"asin":"0156027321","parent_asin":"0156027321","user_id":"AG6GPIKENPZRBMYKTGNF46XUN7FA","timestamp":1068659702000,"helpful_vote":16,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2155,"length_group":3}

{"rating":2,"title":"He Really, Really Wanted to Like It","text":"Fair notice: I ordered this for my husband, who was in Naval aviation (aerographer). He has more military aircraft reference books than you can possibly count, and he's been researching this stuff since he was a small boy (he's now 62). He's a big fan of all aviation movies, even if the best thing about a film is the shots of the aircraft, and he loves TOP GUN the film (except, as he says, for the romantic stuff).<br \/><br \/>His Pros: There are some very good photographs in this volume. Interesting information was given about the original movie, but just a few hints of the upcoming sequel. Maverick's F-18 is referenced, but no photos are shown. Some of the history stated was okay.<br \/><br \/>His Cons: Photographic captions are incorrect in many cases; example, there are two photos saying the aircraft is \"F-18 Tomcat.\" One of them is the opening photo for chapter 1! The F-14 is a Tomcat, not an F-18. Another photo is purportedly a photo of Canadian ace Alfred Ball sitting in the cockpit of his SE5A. There is no airplane in the picture. Plus there are no photographs whatsoever of the F6F \"Hellcat\" and F4U \"Corsair,\" which were famous for their exploits in World War II. How can you do a history of fighter pilots without showing these two aircraft?<br \/><br \/>The narrative is disjointed. The first chapter is about the original movie and then the next about the founding of the real life school \"Topgun\" (always one word for the school; TOP GUN, two words, is the movie), then they skip to a \"history\" of Naval aviation films, not mentioning some significant ones (FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER, THUNDERBOLT, MEN OF THE FIGHTING LADY, for example), but also talking about KING KONG (which is not an aviation film by any stretch of the imagination). There is also a photograph of Grace Kelly and another of Charles Lindbergh in the movie section, with no text indicating what they have to do with aviation films. Then they go into different time periods that used fighter aircraft and jump back and forth from the modern era to WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, with no rhyme nor reason.<br \/><br \/>Plus there is a chapter about fighter pilots in pulp magazines and comic strips, with no mention of the three most famous comic strips concerning pilots: TERRY AND THE PIRATES, BUZ SAWYER, and STEVE CANYON!<br \/><br \/>There is also a chapter about training a fighter pilot with no photos of the Navy's standard jet trainer. Most of the chapter is, in fact, taken over by the story of an Air Force mechanic who \"stole\" an F-86 fighter in 1956, without ever going into what fighter pilot training is like. There was also what he thought was an irrelevant sidebar about Chuck Yeager.<br \/><br \/>Husband suggests this book needs an editor who has a better knowledge of aviation, aircraft, and aviation film history. If you ARE interested in aviation on film, he suggests the books CELLULOID WINGS and FLYING ON FILM.","images":[],"asin":"0760363544","parent_asin":"0760363544","user_id":"AGNSUP65FG6GKSCQJKEH7A4YZLEQ","timestamp":1561403537325,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2913,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"I wish I could give this 2 1\/2 stars","text":"I went into this book with high hopes.  I'd seen a review calling this Hogwarts without magic.  Not that I don't like stories with magical setups, I do, I love them.  It's just that I read Ranger's Apprentice and I liked it so much I was ready for a story with protagonists who can't fall back on spells or wandwork to get them out of sticky situations.<br \/><br \/>But right off the bat, this book was a little off.  In the first couple of pages there are strange grammar choices that don't make sense.  The dialogue is stilted and it's hard to get a feel for any of the characters.<br \/><br \/>I didn't get an Advanced Reader Copy, my copy is the real deal, hardback, the final version, yet there was a strange unedited feel to it.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, back to the story.  Or, at least back to the book, I say that because I had a hard time getting interested in the story.  Because of the weirdly unnatural dialogue it was hard to like or care about the main characters.  I wanted to, boy did I and I was hoping the book would be exciting enough for me to read it aloud to my 9 year old.  But the excitement was mostly muted.<br \/><br \/>So, in short, I didn't much care for this book but I did finish it (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1).

{"rating":2,"title":"Hoping this is not Grant's enduring style!","text":"First, I was a five star reviewer of Grant's RUN - and was prepared for his style.  I like short chapters (ala James Patterson) - but I also like a very straight forward treatment of a convoluted mystery\/thriller. Didn't quite get it this time.  I was also prepared to dislike the majority of Grant's characters, as they are exposed &#34;warts and all&#34;.  And, some of their innermost thoughts do not inspire butterflies and bunnies.  I was prepared, too, to be left hanging a number of times, but, frankly, in False Friend, the many end of chapter hooks did not promote curiosity, as where Devereaux was going and what he was going to do was often predictable.<br \/><br \/>There was more reason not to get cozy with Cooper Devereaux - more mysteries of his past laid open, and more of his rules-bending. Would it be asking too much to give Cooper a sense of humor?  There's nothing to laugh at in 285 pages.  He's got a lot of diverse company - the local police, the FBI, and even the Mafia gets their licks in.  All in pursuit of a serial killer, an arsonist and a blackmailer.  And it left me with a lot of questions.  Why does Alexandra, ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter, stick around - as she spends half her time looking at her front door, trying to decide whether to lock him out or not.  Doesn't she know that, as a police detective, he will always have to put the call from his chief first?  Her time would be better spent looking over the daughter's shoulder - 'cause there's lots going on there. And then, there's the newspaper reporter, trying to live up to her grandfather's reputation - who is harboring a son giving off loud and clear signals that would  make any tuned-in Mom's alarm bells ring.  MIne did, very early on.  And, finally, I think there was enough happening without bringing in the blackmailer!<br \/><br \/>Grant doesn't want us to feel warm and fuzzy when his stories end.  He wants us left up in a tree, still trying to find answers to the questions he leaves behind.  My last question was, why did Grant title the book FALSE FRIEND?  Devereaux never stood still long enough to have a friend - and after cruising the list of characters, I'm still not sure which one was false.<br \/><br \/>All of this is not to say I did not think the novel was well written and kept the pages turning.  For me, it lacked satisfaction - not in having finished it, but having found a comfortable close to all the events, issues, and mysteries that it stirred up.

{"rating":2,"title":"A more than usually absurd, Harlequin Presents, sheikh romance","text":"In the imaginary, alternate-universe, Middle Eastern kingdom of Tahar, 30-year-old Prince Tarek suddenly finds himself elevated to King when his venal, narcissistic, evilly cruel elder brother, who had no son and heir, suddenly dies of a drug overdose. Tarek discovers, to his horror, on reading his brother’s journals, that his brother murdered their parents when Tarek was 15, in order to ascend to the throne. He also tortured young Tarek, then banished him to the desert, where he has lived in a cave like an isolated monk for the last 15 years. Tarek’s brother assigned him some kind of military role that seems to have involved battles with weapons so primitive, they were something out of the early sixteenth century. Tarek is described as fighting only with a sword and facing “steel-tipped arrows” on the battlefield. He also functioned as some sort of assassin on behalf of his brother, but no details are given as to how he might have pulled that off successfully using only a huge scimitar in a world of guns. In spite of having no education past the age of 15, having no access to modern technology such as cell phones or the internet, not reading newspapers, books, seeing movies or TV, Tarek speaks perfect, fluent English. It is never explained what he did in his cave for toileting, bathing, laundry, and meals—other than somehow maintaining a coffee habit. He has never had sex and has staunchly refused to give in to sexual urgings whatsoever, so apparently he has never even engaged in self-stimulation. His entire personal identity involves martyring himself as a “weapon” for his country. Tarek is not described for most of the book as wearing the thobe (robe) or the Taqiyah (head covering), and there is no mention (as there never is in HP sheikh romances) of his following Muslim religious practices, in particular, prostrating himself to pray five times per day. In fact, the only Muslim practice that typically (but not always) appears in HP sheikh romances, including this one, is avoiding alcohol.<br \/><br \/>Olivia comes from a wealthy American family. She suffered from “poor little rich girl” syndrome in that her parents were so obsessed with caring for her chronically, dangerously ill younger sister, they basically ignored her throughout her childhood. At university, she met the prince of a fictional European country, married him, and became his queen for five years until his untimely death. Though she is not the typical HP, virgin heroine, we are assured her husband was 26-year-old Olivia’s only lover. Because she and her deceased husband produced no heir, his younger brother became king, and Olivia’s presence in that country became surplus to requirements. Because she views herself as highly skilled in the political maneuvering required of monarchs, and the only career she is interested in pursuing is to continue being a queen, her brother-in-law offers her the chance to help her adopted homeland gain important political advantages by entering into a nineteenth-century-type arranged marriage with Tahar’s new, unmarried king.<br \/><br \/>After Olivia arrives in Tahar, she realizes from her very first meeting with the devastatingly attractive and mysteriously aloof Tarek that a political alliance with him won’t just involve doing her honorable duty. It could prove to be a real pleasure. It would be quite entertaining smoothing down half-wild Tarek’s rough edges, and she eagerly anticipates the joys of sharing the marriage bed with the gorgeous brute.<br \/><br \/>Tarek is fully aware that he will need to marry and produce an heir, but at first he believes a foreign woman will simply make it all the more difficult to move from self-enforced celibacy to cohabitation. However, Olivia does such a convincing job persuading Tarek that, with her skills as an experienced queen, she could quickly and efficiently help him transition from unpolished warrior to a sophisticated king, he reluctantly agrees to give her a few days to concretely prove her grandiose claims.<br \/><br \/>Olivia is quite surprised when Tarek escorts her to a bedchamber himself because, unlike in a typical HP sheikh romance, the Tahar monarch’s palace is not crawling with hordes of willing servants. She is even more amazed when her assigned space is right next door to Tarek’s own suite. This unconventional setup permits the occurrence of a classic romance trope, the accidental, lust-inducing, nude sighting. That night while lying in bed, Olivia hears grunts and shouts coming from Tarek’s room. She gets up, peeks out of her bedroom door, and is awed and turned on at the magnificent sight of a sleepwalking, naked Tarek, who is stomping up and down the corridor, swinging both a sword high above and his exposed genitals below. As expected for a romance hero, he is described as having muscular thighs and a bodybuilder’s physique, even though all he’s ever done is brandish a sword and shoot arrows. He’s never routinely hoisted heavy objects.<br \/><br \/>I had the following issues with this novel that made it a less than appealing read for me:<br \/><br \/>1. It is typical of HP sheikh romances that their mythical Arab nations bear no resemblance to any Arab nation in the real world. But this book takes that inaccuracy to an absolute extreme. Tarek’s sixteenth-century-style, sword-and-arrows battles would only make sense if this were a time-travel novel—which it is not.<br \/><br \/>2. Why on earth would Tarek’s brother keep journals lying around in which he exposes his every crime, most especially patricide and matricide? Not only that, keeping a journal is a rather nerdy thing to do, not something one would expect from a chaotically corrupt, self-indulgent addict.<br \/><br \/>3. As is typical of HP sheikh heroes, Tarek does not act like a Muslim. He does not regularly pray, almost never dresses like an Arab male, and he is clean shaven rather than having a beard. In this case, Tarek initially has a wild, scraggly beard, but he allows Olivia to shave it off entirely, rather than simply neatly trimming it.<br \/><br \/>4. At her wedding to Tarek, we learn that Olivia doesn’t speak or even understand Arabic. It is obvious she also does not speak or understand the most common language in the Muslim world, Urdu. This means that the only way Tarek and Olivia could realistically communicate is with an interpreter. The author chooses to conveniently ignore that issue entirely, presenting Tarek as speaking fluent English, even though his having that skill is not at all well motivated. (Stating once in the story that, during his 15 years in his cave, he would march up and down talking to himself in several languages he learned from his father, so he wouldn’t forget them, just doesn’t cut it.) Not only that, later in the book Tarek reads and fully comprehends English-language sex manuals in order to be able to perform like a virtuoso in bed, as all romance heroes are expected to do.<br \/><br \/>5. Speaking of sex manuals: The author’s entire goal in this story is to flip the typical, HP trope of a virgin heroine matched with a sexually experienced hero, but the setup of Tarek’s being a monkish virgin living in a cave for 15 years is utterly improbable. Also, his, also unrealistically, studying sex manuals rather than allowing Olivia, as an experienced widow, to instruct him in what she enjoys in bed, is a missed opportunity to milk this trope reversal to the full.<br \/><br \/>6. Olivia’s decision that the only career she wants in life is to be a queen is, in the twenty-first century, decidedly odd, if not slightly unhinged.<br \/><br \/>I experienced this novel as an audiobook, which I obtained through Hoopla. For the most part, the narrator does an adequate job but, irritatingly, she consistently mispronounces sheikh as “sheek” rather than “shayk.”<br \/><br \/>I rate this book as follows:<br \/><br \/>Heroine: 2 stars<br \/>Hero: 2 stars<br \/>Setting: 2 stars<br \/>Romance Plot: 2 stars<br \/>Writing: 2 stars<br \/>Audiobook Narration: 3 stars<br \/>Overall: 2 stars","images":[],"asin":"0373133685","parent_asin":"0373133685","user_id":"AHW7ETGBKGX6DCG2LBAG5YAXU46A","timestamp":1650947926135,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":8038,"length_group":3}

The stitch treasuries are poorly printed (the textured and lace stitches in dark blue and dark purple lose all their detail), and the stitch patterns (a patchy, limited selection) have mostly been published elsewhere.  The project patterns are few in number, and are modern designs that merely use well-known \"heirloom\" stitches.<br \/><br \/>Also, the project designs are not particularly inspired.  The projects are a basic square tote bag, a textured hot water bottle cover, house slippers, a beret, a twisted-stitch cowl, a baby blanket, a cabled cushion cover, a cabled cardigan, lacy-cuffed socks, a Hap shawl, a Fair Isle child's sweater (one band of Fair Isle across the chest), and Norwegian mittens.

{"rating":2,"title":"A Pale Version of the Original","text":"I became friends with Rebecca Rowena Randall via a Whitman hardback, way back when I was eight years old, admiring her grit, her creativity, and her blossoming from feckless young girl to poised young woman, rejoicing in her successes and commiserating in her defeats. I was delighted later to find a second book of her adventures that added more childhood events and even stories about her friends.<br \/><br \/>Eric Wiggin isn't related to Kate Douglas Wiggin, although some of his biographies have stated so. He took two classics, REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM and NEW CHRONICLES OF REBECCA, simplified all of Kate Wiggin's lovely poetic Edwardian language, and blended them into one narrative spanning two books, then produced this novel, a sequel to both, layering on a thick smear of overt Christianity to what was already a Christian-themed book. Not only does this heavy-handed moralizing reduce poor Rebecca to boring adulthood, but Wiggin also saddles every country character (like Rebecca's mother) with cheap rural accents (Aunt Jane suddenly has one, too). Kate Wiggin says John Randall went to medical school; in this John stays around to do farm chores. Where Eric Wiggin might have expanded on the characters of Rebecca's siblings Mark, Fanny, and Jenny, instead they are reduced to the background, while we listen to Adam Ladd repeat what improvements the railroad will make to Sunnybrook and the surrounding countryside ad infinitum. (Just how many times can you comment about the difference a standard-gauge railway instead of a narrow-gauge one will make?) (I also noticed Mr. Wiggin lowers \"Mr. Aladdin's\" age so hopefully people will forget Rebecca's being courted by a man twenty years older than she is.) Oh, and Harriet Beecher Stowe makes an appearance, despite the fact that Rebecca was written in 1904 and in this book everyone is getting a telephone, and Stowe died in 1896.<br \/><br \/>Add to the fact that Mr. Wiggin kills off a regular character and then spends his time indiscriminately matching up adult characters in holy wedlock...well, the book ends up being a disservice to Kate Wiggin, but most of all to the wonderful spirit of Rebecca Randall.

{"rating":2,"title":"It felt unfinished to me!","text":"I am in the minority here, because I had several issues with this story.  Spoilers. . .  First, the author went on and on in detail about the Morgan's time in captivity, but frankly I didn't understand most of it.  It's dark, then there is light, I was confused by the changing descriptions.  I didn't think she was actually held that long?  But we are never given real information.  I kind of felt like we were reading a Scooby Doo mystery with all the misleading info for so many different suspects! Reid, the husband, making out with her best friend?  And somehow, her captor has a picture of them kissing and leaves it for Morgan to see.  There is never any discussion about it later.  A police officer that seems like something is off with him and then no more explanation about that.  I actually did see the one red flag that meant something.  I don't appreciate an author throwing out all these misleading bits of information and then leaving them unfinished.  Like we never get the details about all the previous victims, we only get info on two of the twelve. How did the Wolf go from being a cop to a news anchor to becoming a serial killer?  His uncle, did he and his wife help and know from the beginning what he was doing?  I felt the first two thirds of the book really dragged on, I skimmed, but the end felt rushed and I felt like I still had so many questions left unanswered.  I finished it feeling unsatisfied.

{"rating":2,"title":"Book two in the paranormal series","text":"I really enjoy paranormal and Sci-Fi stories. Not being someone who enjoys reading detailed torture with lots of gore and hopelessness, and feels kinda scared of someone who enjoys writing about it, this book was a turnoff. Those parts I had to skip over.

Still, it didn't make for reading pleasure, Gd help us if these novels are being read and enjoyed.<br \/><br \/>Book One - NO PEACE FOR THE ... (July 2012): Magnolia Kelch is no stranger to pain. Beautiful and powerful, she’s spent her entire life at the mercy of her sadistic father and the rest of the Kelch clan, who have tortured her and tested the limits of her powers. After one particularly heinous night that leaves Magnolia nearly dead, she finally sees her chance for escape…But this first taste of freedom is short-lived when she collides with Thirteen, head of the Network—a secret organization dedicated to fighting supernatural criminals—who recruits her into the group. Even as she’s coming to grips with this new life and the horrific memories that still haunt her, she’s conflicted by her growing attraction to fellow team member Theo and the emergence of new, untested abilities. After months of grueling training, her loyalty to the team is tested when she learns her target is the Network’s most wanted: the Kelch family. Revenge may course through her veins, but so does the blood of the Kelches. And opposing her family may cost her the thing she treasures most. After all, Magnolia is still a Kelch. And the Kelch are d*mned.","images":[],"asin":"1477807632","parent_asin":"1477807632","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1396311346000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1672,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Multiple Ongoing Investigations Are Hard to Follow; Too Much Detailed Description of Torture Scenes","text":"Lizzy Gardner is another of the new crop of psychologically-damaged female investigators that are perhaps inspired by the success of the [[ASIN:B00452V49A Mallory]] and [[ASIN:0307949486 Lisbeth Salander]] mystery series.  Lizzy's particular \"issue\" is that she's paranoid about personal safety--understandably enough, since she was kidnapped and held captive for some months by serial killer Spyderman when she was a mere teenager (see [[ASIN:1612185096 Abducted (The Lizzy Gardner Series #1)]]).<br \/><br \/>In A DARK MIND, private investigator Lizzy and her detective boyfriend Jared run afoul of another serial killer--the \"Lovebird Killer\" (LK), who delights in surveilling couples who are unusually devoted to each other, and then capturing, torturing, and killing one or both \"lovebirds\".  Lizzy comes to LK's attention because she was hired by two of his victims to investigate a dubious workman's compensation claim by one of their former employees.  Jared is actually assigned to a task force that is investigating LK's crimes and attempting to apprehend him.<br \/><br \/>Much of the book's actual investigating is carried out by Lizzy's assistant Jessica (who spots suspicious garbage bag activity at a construction site she is assigned to watch), and by Lizzy's troubled teenaged helper Hayley (who has been released from jail with a GPS anklet that is supposed to confine her to Lizzy's home, but who doesn't let that stop her from seeking to protect her mother from an abusive boyfriend).  Because there are three different investigative plot lines (Lizzy, Jessica, Hayley) that constantly shift their California locations (Sacramento, Davis, Antelope, Granite Bay, etc.), I found the story quite hard to follow.<br \/><br \/>Chapters begin with quotes from real-life serial killers (David Berkowitz, Ted Bundy, John Christie, etc.) that sort of talk about these famous killers' motives.  The story itself is developed through alternating short segments that recount the ongoing progress of the different investigations.  The segments are headed by generic place and time labels (e.g., \"Sacramento, Thursday, May 10, 2012\", or \"Davis, Friday, May 11, 2012\").  I have no idea what purpose is served by the famous-killer quotes, and the generic labels didn't help me at all to sort out when and where things were happening in the investigations.  The labels were simply confusing.<br \/><br \/>For my taste, LK's gruesome torture crimes are described in far too much loving detail.  Also, I disliked the conclusions to the three investigations--none were particularly believable, one had echoes of Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", and one left a character that I'd come to like a lot in a very bad place.  I rate A DARK MIND at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1611099854","parent_asin":"1611099854","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1391482755000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2780,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Torn. I should have loved it.","text":"I should have loved this story. It had everything that should have made this a riveting read. There was a mystery, interesting characters and a twist. I shouldn’t have been able to put this book down, but I found that I did over and over again, and had to force myself to pick it up. So in an effort to be fair to the author, who I am sure put her heart and soul into this story, I will explain my rating by dividing this review into two portions: what I like and what I didn’t.<br \/><br \/>What I liked:<br \/>*Plot potential. Basically Solemn is a young girl, living in a trailer park, who sees something she shouldn’t. She is a keeper of several secrets.<br \/>*Tons of imagery. Even the trailer park itself is symbolic of a sense of despair and isolation.<br \/>*Interesting characters. The story is told from various point of views. Among them the young girl, a police officer and a mother. You see the events through their eyes. Their perception of the events vary depending on their perspective and interests.<br \/>*There were undertones of various social issues (i.e., education, poverty, race, domestic violence, alcoholism and drug use) woven throughout the story.<br \/><br \/>What I didn’t like (which explains my low rating):<br \/>*The story was hard to follow, and hard to read. It almost seemed like a collaboration between Toni Morrison, Alice Walker and Sapphire, with a little Octavia Butler thrown in for good measure. What should have worked in theory didn’t. Instead it seemed a little all over the place. Unfort<br \/>unately, instead of one cohesive story or collaboration, it meandered and skipped around. There were times that the writing was so wordy, that I got a little lost and confused in the story. I found myself skipping sections or re-reading sections which isn’t a good sign. Perhaps in the next few weeks, I will re-read this book and revisit my review. Otherwise, I give this story 2 stars.","images":[],"asin":"1250091594","parent_asin":"1250091594","user_id":"AEGYU6OM2X66SMZN6AF3TSQ3N5PQ","timestamp":1465528852000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1920,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Usable journal but too vintage-looking for my taste with \"dirty\" pages and cheaply dyed leather","text":"This journal is usable in the sense that writing on the paper with pen or pencil works well. However, I consider this substandard because it is too vintage-looking for my taste.<br \/><br \/>As is typical of a leather-bound journal, the paper is not replaceable. The pages have smudges on them throughout and sometimes lint and other stuff. The underside of the leather is poorly dyed looking as if it is dirty. The tie is just a string of leather and not set in a way that makes it intuitive to tie the book shut. The embossing on the outside is attractive, however.<br \/><br \/>There are five sections that are \"stitched\" into the book. Each section has a centerfold string as can be seen in the fourth photo.<br \/><br \/>The nine photos show the following in order:<br \/>1 - The attractive stitching on the binding and the outer leather embossing.<br \/>2 - The front of the journal and the only way I was able to tie it.<br \/>3 - A picture of the five sections.<br \/>4 - The centerfold leather string for each section.<br \/>5 - The blotchy spots typical throughout many of the pages.<br \/>6 - The light blotchy spots (on left page) and lint through certain pages of the book. It is hard to see in the photo but it is there.<br \/>7 & 8 - The  inside leather cover and blotchy dye work.<br \/>9 - The center dot is actually the tie string that is knotted in the center of the small front flap.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this is a cheaply made journal and they succeeded in making this look dirty vintage and handmade from scrap. The exterior embossing of a tree design is attractive and so is the binder stitching. The leather is cheap and the paper is blotchy, dirty, and full of lint. This is definitely usable but not up to the standard I would expect of a leather-bound journal especially with the dirty blotches that appear on some pages. Since the intention here is to look vintage, I would say they over succeeded. I would not expect to pay more than $18 for this in its current condition. However, I personally do not care for it although others might find this very attractive with that \"found in the attic\" sort of treasure that has been laying around for years.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61+6Wx8zfOL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61+6Wx8zfOL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61+6Wx8zfOL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/6118SGYGiWL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/6118SGYGiWL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/6118SGYGiWL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61PfQYR872L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61PfQYR872L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61PfQYR872L.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61V+2nie1qL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61V+2nie1qL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61V+2nie1qL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61fQksUUmEL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61fQksUUmEL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61fQksUUmEL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61sO-vvzS5L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61sO-vvzS5L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61sO-vvzS5L.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71RPwpeCXBL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71RPwpeCXBL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71RPwpeCXBL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71fFS3x+qqL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71fFS3x+qqL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71fFS3x+qqL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81hy11XencL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81hy11XencL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81hy11XencL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B07PZVN2WN","parent_asin":"B099MSX3TZ","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1555973962857,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2165,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Low rating is for the abridged audiobook, not for Meg Cabot's writing","text":"This is book 5 in the Mediator series, starring Susannah (Suze) Simon, a 16-year-old, high-school girl who encourages (and sometimes forces) recalcitrant ghosts to move on to the afterlife and stop bothering the living. Suze's powers include the ability to not only see ghosts but touch them. Which is a blessing when she can be hugged, and once or twice kissed, by the gorgeous ghost Jesse, who died in 1850 and haunts her bedroom in a restored, historic house in Carmel, California. Being touched by ghosts is not so great when they beat her up, hold a knife to her throat, or throw her off the roof of her home.<br \/><br \/>In this book, Cabot introduces a romantic triangle, when 17-year-old Paul Slater, who is also a mediator, and whom Suze met in [[ASIN:0060725141 Darkest Hour (The Mediator #4)]], enrolls in Suze's school. Paul is almost as gorgeous as Jesse, and he has the further advantage of being alive and intensely interested in becoming romantically involved with Suze--which Jesse seems sadly reluctant to do. The problem is, Paul is an amoral jerk who blackmails Suze into spending time with him based on the threat of exiling Jesse to the spiritual realms where Suze will never see him again.<br \/><br \/>As is the case in the previous four books of this series, Cabot has written an enthralling, action-filled, paranormal mystery novel with strong romantic subplots. Suze is a very strong, active, sympathetic heroine, and there is a great deal of humor based in Suze's self-deprecating, dry wit and her toe-to-toe repartee with multiple other characters, most especially her clueless stepbrothers, whom she dubs Dopey and Sleepy. The paranormal elements are well done, and Jesse is a wonderful love interest. Paul is a multi-layered antagonist who is both sexy and obnoxious, a fascinating combination.<br \/><br \/>Sadly, unlike the audio recordings of the other five books in this series, for some unfathomable reason, this one has been abridged. I do *not* recommend experiencing this book in this manner. The abridging makes the reader lose out on many important plot details. In addition, this is a different narrator than the one employed for the other five books, and she completely misinterprets Jesse, making his tone seductive when talking to Suze, which is never the case for gentlemanly Jesse, who is very protective of Suze's virtue. It's as if the narrator got Jesse confused with Paul.<br \/><br \/>Overall rating:<br \/>Meg Cabot's original book (which is butchered in this abridged edition): 5 stars<br \/>Audiobook abridging: 1 star<br \/>Audiobook narration: 2 stars<br \/><br \/>Buy this as a Kindle edition or paperback instead.","images":[],"asin":"B000FG5NWE","parent_asin":"B000FG5NWE","user_id":"AHW7ETGBKGX6DCG2LBAG5YAXU46A","timestamp":1375229640000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2660,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Tough-as-Nails Female Investigator Becomes Serial Killer's Prey","text":"COMPULSION is another of those improbably-plotted mystery\/thrillers that feature a supposedly fearless, tough-as-nails female investigator, who has adopted a masculine nickname (here, Max for Maxine), who becomes the principal prey for the serial killer she is tracking.  This novel also follows the usual formula that requires the investigator to demonstrate her inner feminine vulnerability to her lovers and to everyone else, before she successfully winds up her investigation.<br \/><br \/>Max Revere is an investigative reporter and TV personality.  Her show, \"Maximum Exposure\", features cold cases involving missing persons.  Max is motivated by the altruistic desire to help left-behind family members obtain closure, because of her life experiences involving the separate disappearances of her mother and her best friend.  Above all, Max wants to find out the truth behind each and every missing person's disappearance, and she doesn't care who is hurt, as long as the truth comes out.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, a seemingly ordinary bartender (Bachman) is on trial for murdering five women.  These were perfect crimes, but he was captured when his drugged sixth victim, stowed in the trunk of his car, woke up too early and screamed loudly enough to attract the attention of the police at a traffic stop.  Max is convinced that Bachman also killed a missing older couple whose bodies have never been found, and that Bachman had a partner who assisted with the killings.  But no one in law enforcement or TV network news believes Max's theory about the partner--least of all the prosecutor (Max's former lover) who is trying Bachman for murder.<br \/><br \/>Max has a reputation for always getting people to answer her questions, and for always getting the interviews or anything else that she wants.  Her secret is her tenacity--she simply hammers away until she wears people down.  Among those people are various men--her former and current lovers (the prosecutor, an FBI agent, a California detective), her gay bodyguard, and her TV network chief--and a couple of women (a female cop that she helped, and an over-eager office assistant).  The men are in love with Max, each in his own way, and they all stampede to her aid when she lands in deep trouble.<br \/><br \/>COMPULSION is well-written, with good characterization, but it's a long, long read.  Through most of the book, Max spends a lot of time: (1) trying to prove her partner theory, through interviews and ethically questionable investigative tactics; (2) recalling weekends with her opposite-Coast lover; (3) attempting to rein in her gung-ho assistant who wants to be just like her; (4) musing about her childhood, her feelings of abandonment, and how her mother lied about her father's identity; and (5) telling herself how important it is for missing persons' families to finally discover the truth about their disappeared family members, thanks to Max's hard work.  There is an exciting, page-turning conclusion, but by then the plot has become totally unbelievable.<br \/><br \/>Because COMPULSION is tedious, has unappealing female characters, and utilizes a plot that strains all credulity, I rate it at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1250035023","parent_asin":"1250035023","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1423700026000,"helpful_vote":12,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3233,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"A Fairly Bad Book","text":"They say you can't judge a book by its cover but I've always thought you could to some degree. Publishers would only hire the great cover artists for their books they thought would be immense successes. 2nd string artists got the rest of the work on book they were taking a chance on. The cover of this book looks like it was done in ten or fifteen minutes in Microsoft's Paint. I should have stopped there and declined the book but I made myself finish both of the stories this contained.<br \/><br \/>The book reads like it was written in a language other than English and then translated over. If this is the case then it's one of the better translations that I've come across but the dialog, phrasing and writing is still strange to my English raised ears. Dialog like; &#34;Tell your parents I am coming for a visit. I will see you all after three days.&#34; just don't sound right and they jarred me completely out of the narrative when I came across them which was sadly all too often.<br \/><br \/>The first and longest story is a retelling, modern day take on the Cinderella tale. While I can suspend belief for a lot of things the main plot, actions of the characters and yes, the dialog, were just too much. If you're held captive in an inescapable house but can see people walking by why don't you break a window and scream for help? If you've been told your husband or wife died while you were sick wouldn't one of the first things you'd do on recovery be visiting their grave to pay your respects? So many things should have ended this story before it actually happened. It's just too unbelievable which added to the bad dialog made for a book I could not enjoy.<br \/><br \/>The 2nd story should put parents in a panic to reinforce their don't talk to strangers and never go off on the motorcycle of some strange adult you met ten minutes earlier. Seriously? This story read like a mediocre grammar school writing project.

{"rating":2,"title":"Full Story of Dishonest Impresario's Exploitation of Small Group of Igorrotes at Beginning of Twentieth Century","text":"The U.S. Government's \"Philippine Reservation\" was one of the most popular exhibits at the 1904 St. Louis Exposition.  It displayed some 1300 native Filipinos, taken from a dozen different tribes, with the intention of building popular support for the continuing U.S. occupation of the Philippines after the Spanish-American War.  The human exhibits of daily tribal living served to illustrate to the U.S. citizenry that Filipinos were innocents who were unready for self-government.  When the Exposition closed, the Filipinos were returned to their native land.<br \/><br \/>A few years later, two impresarios (Truman Hunt and Richard Schneidewind) independently brought small groups of Filipinos from the Igorrote tribe to the U.S. to continue as human exhibits.  In Hunt's case, some of the Igorrotes were returnees from the St. Louis Exposition.  All of the Igorrotes came willingly, having been promised pay for their performances.  Schneidewind treated his Igorrotes well, setting them up in an authentic village that was clean and pleasant.  Schneidewind's exhibit also included informative lectures, so that it had a strong educational ethos.<br \/><br \/>In contrast, Hunt set his Igorrotes up in Luna Park (on Coney Island) and forced them to build fake structures (e.g., a \"medicine man's hut\" on stilts), to prepare daily \"dog meat\" feasts (even though the Igorrotes held such feasts only on special occasions such as weddings), and to stage a pro forma \"native wedding\" to draw in curious crowds.  Hunt made up many stories about the Igorrotes' customs for publicity purposes (although it was true that the Igorrotes were head-hunters, and normally wore little clothing).  After Hunt landed in considerable legal trouble (beginning with an accusation of a bigamous marriage), he went on the run with some of his Igorrotes and produced a traveling show.  Eventually the Igorrotes sued Hunt for taking their money, and a lengthy trial ensued.<br \/><br \/>THE LOST TRIBE OF CONEY ISLAND tells the full story of Hunt's exhibition and involvement with the Igorottes--from Hunt's selection of Igorottes in the Philippines,  to his initial wild success at Luna Park, to the impact of his legal problems on the exhibit, to his final total loss of the Igorrotes' trust, to the messy conclusion of the Igorrotes' lawsuit against Hunt.<br \/><br \/>The narrative itself is immensely bloated, filled with the author's speculations about the participants' thoughts and feelings at every stage of their disastrous experience.  For example, the opening of Chapter 3, \"The Journey from the Tropics\", about the group's trip from the Philippines to the U.S. on the steamship RMS Empress of China:  \"The tribespeople bent their heads back as far as they could, but still they couldn't see the tops of her funnels.  Tainan felt a fluttering sensation in his stomach.  With wide eyes, he jumped up, as if hoping the few extra inches would help him take in the ship's full splendor. . . . Daipan wished her father were there to witness the incredible sight before them.  The RMS Empress of China was a huge, hulking beauty . . . .\"<br \/><br \/>To my mind, Hunt's exploitation story is a story that isn't worth retelling--certainly not in a 338-page narrative (exclusive of footnotes).  I rate this book at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"054426228X","parent_asin":"054426228X","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1413229162000,"helpful_vote":15,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3346,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Historical Novel Based on Insubstantial Real-Life Incident","text":"I thoroughly enjoyed Amy Stewart's previous anecdotal nonfiction books, [[ASIN:1565126831 Wicked Plants]] and [[ASIN:1565129601 Wicked Bugs]].  However, GIRL WAITS WITH GUN--a fictionalized account of Constance Kopp's 1914-1915 ordeal involving death-threat letters and a plot to kidnap a female member of her family--makes me wish that Stewart had stuck with straight nonfiction and left historical fiction alone.<br \/><br \/>The facts of the real-life incident strike me as too thin to sustain a full-length novel.  Constance's buggy was totaled by an automobile, and the automobile's owner, a wealthy silk dyer, refused to pay for the damages.  Instead, the businessman and his gang of thugs harassed Constance and her family at their farm for several months (by writing threatening \"Black Hand\" letters, breaking into the farmhouse, and plotting to kidnap the youngest woman).  Eventually, with Constance's considerable help, the unscrupulous silk dyer was arrested, tried, and convicted, and Constance was offered a deputy sheriff's job (making her one of the very first female deputy sheriffs in the U.S.).<br \/><br \/>There are some subplots involving the terrible treatment of clothing factory workers, the disappearance of evacuated children of striking factory workers, and the transport of wayward girls to private institutions where they could stay during their confinements.  The subplots have predictable outcomes, and add little suspense.<br \/><br \/>Stewart is an able writer, but the story just plods along.  It is told mostly chronologically, with a few flashbacks, and there is too much meaningless imagined detail.  The novel is boring from the very outset.

I remember the day I tried out urban fantasy books, and I protested the whole way. Turns out I fell in love with them. Now I can't imagine a world without werewolves and fae and everything else in between. So why not venture out? Maybe there is something out there for me that I never would have thought to give a chance, a book somewhere on a shelf that will stay with me for years to come. So here I go on my journey to find that book.<br \/><br \/>To start this is a period book. The thing about period books is that as an English major and well quite frankly as a history minor I have read pieces of literature from this time, and they sound nothing like this. Although I get the reasoning behind it. I can remember struggling to understand the words on the page before me, and trying to figure out what they were saying in 1775. How the English language evolves over years is amazing to me. So that being said I believe the author did her very best to convey the times while still writing in a dialect that the average person living in 2000's could understand.<br \/><br \/>For me this book contains a lot of God. Almost to much for my liking. It's a personal preference. I understand the need for God in this book, this woman is starting over after one of the most tragic things that could happen to a person have happened to her, both her son and her husband dead within a years time. To rebuild a life after that, to strike out on her own, you need something to hold on to, and I understand that need wholeheartedly. The only thing that bothered me about the continuing mention of God 18 times on every page was Abby was on a journey to find herself, to become herself, and instead she spends so much time focusing on what God wants, and forgets to listen to her wants and needs.<br \/><br \/>Beth is really the only person I found moving throughout the book. She is a young girl who has literally turned into a bitter angry girl by following her fathers example. She tries so hard to be hard, to be like her father, that she knows no other way to be. The journey that she and Abby take together, in showing Beth that it is okay to be a girl, to want to be happy is okay, it's moving to see.<br \/><br \/>I found the last couple of chapters very rushed. The sudden reappearance and acceptance of Conner's son felt unnatural. The then sudden return of the supposed dead wife, Sally, is the most forced, surreal, part of the book. In all of like a chapter she arrives, throws everything into disarray, and then dies. And then oh my gosh, Abby and Conner and wed and live happily ever after. All this long buildup to only have this sudden sequence of events happen is just weird.<br \/><br \/>I also felt that the arrival of Hannah was unnecessary, like an attempt by the author to give the other characters in the book some reason to interact with the main characters. And as a way to show Abby has some kind of sway over Conner. Although it should be noted this is a series of books, and I think Hannah ends up being one of the \"brides\" in the course of the series, so maybe that is why she was introduced, either way I don't feel like she made any contribution to the story of Abby.<br \/><br \/>I will say that it was able to keep my attention, I didn't hate it. I didn't like it. But this book is not for me. I can see the appeal for other people though (that is until the last couple of chapters where the entire pace of the book changes). I will not be continuing with the series, but I do enjoy a free book.","images":[],"asin":"B002U0KQV6","parent_asin":"B002U0KQV6","user_id":"AG3XIAIYKMMG356ZP2UJ4RFQTJJA","timestamp":1317574509000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3911,"length_group":3}

THIS book reads like he wrote it in his sleep, relying on a fan base of loyal readers...and not serving them very well at all. His characters get involved in a murder immediately, just happening to visit someone on vacation and seeing a murder within a couple of hours of their arrival. The setting is barren, in a place called Baron, and the characters are bleak sketches of what are usually in-depth portraits of real people with whom the reader can empathize or sympathize...bur the cardboard nature of these characters in this bleak dun-colored watercolor bleed out are not engaging enough for the reader to even bother finishing the book. The author has let us down, seemingly having taken a vacation from his vocation of really writing and crafting a good solid STORY with characters the reader feels are real. The &#34;Memory Man&#34; series started off so well with his first two books, but this one lacks its character. Cadrboard pasteups are not enjoyable to read or care about.

I need to clarify that I am an owner of a Presto 16 qt stovetop pressure canner\/cooker and an Cuisinart electric countertop pressure cooker.  I am not new to pressure cooking.  So, I tried to look at this book with an open mind as if I were a new user.  What I found out was that so much of the book doesn't really deal with actual pressure cooking.  There is a section in there that talks about slow cookers\/crock pots, one for pressure canning and one for pressure cooking.  What it doesn't really deal with is adapting any of your current recipes to pressure cookers, so that was a big disappointment. I really wasn't looking for a crockpot book.  What's more is there is really not a whole lot of recipes either.  I own many other pressure cooker books and they are far better than this one.  Most of the other pressure cooker books out there have enough basics that a person that is new to pressure cooking can learn from them and they are loaded with recipes.  They are focused only on pressure cooking instead of all over the map like this one.  I would invest in these.  My two favorite books are Cooking Under Pressure and Pressure Perfect.

{"rating":2,"title":"Massive Novel, Sorely in Need of Editing","text":"THE ROBOTS OF GOTHAM has an interesting setting--a near future (2083) world populated by humans and sentient robots (some friendly to humans, most at war with humans).  The writing is superficially okay, but it’s sorely in need of editing.  The novel is 675 pages long!<br \/><br \/>The wordiness makes the story confusing, and extremely slow-moving.  In the first 50 pages, there is a big human-robot battle (we aren’t told what’s behind it); the main character (Barry Simcoe) improbably survives a missile hit; he helps treat wounded soldiers and robots despite having no specific training for this; he avoids a firing squad; and he negotiates the repair of a robot (Nineteen Black Winter) that he’s befriended. This may sound like a lot of action, but the book is set in fairly small type, and there is a lot of meaningless back-and-forth conversation between Barry and the other characters in between those actual happenings.<br \/><br \/>Also, Barry’s character lacks believable motivation for his actions.  For example, in the middle of the human-robot battle, himself in mortal danger, he tries to save the lives of two mortally wounded soldiers. Or, as another example, when asked why he’s offering $10,000 to save Nineteen Black Winter’s life, he says that he doesn’t want anyone else to die that day.<br \/><br \/>Worst of all, the plot requires tracking an incredibly complicated political situation, and the story is told through Barry’s blog posts and through robot Thought Machine Paul the Pirate’s dispatches.  The political situation, as described by Paul:  “America is now permanently divided, including the Eastern seaboard and much of the Midwest, under foreign occupation. Under the terms of the Memphis Ceasefire the SCC formally withdrew, leaving the occupied zones administered by the AGRT, a peacekeeping force made up of volunteers from over thirty countries.  Manhattan has been annexed by a weird robot monarchy, while in Tennessee a more permanent peace is being delicately negotiated between the battered remnants of the US government and an envoy of implacable machines.”<br \/><br \/>In case you didn’t quite get that, there is a US map at the beginning of the novel that shows the political boundaries.  There is also a 2-page chart of “The 2083 Sovereignty Matrix” that gives the names of the leaders of world nations and their classifications (human or machine).  Canada is left completely blank on the map, even though protagonist Barry is Canadian; the chart tells us that the Prime Minister is an elected machine.<br \/><br \/>A novel like this is just too much work for me.  It may be the start of some sweeping saga that will eventually gain a huge following (like Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones), but I’m going to wait for the movie or TV series.","images":[],"asin":"1328711013","parent_asin":"1328711013","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1534177194107,"helpful_vote":12,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2782,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Tedious reading...","text":"It isn't easy to disagree with so many great reviews - and all the hype - gripping, thrilling, surprising - and the fact that this novel seems to have been optioned for a possible film - and the foreign rights have sold like hot cakes.  I found it to be tedious reading.  To be fair, the novel does have a fresh premise - it's about a disappearance but there's definitely a different twist involved - and not one you've run into over and over.<br \/><br \/>The story is told by three characters - Stephanie, the put-upon friend\/blogger, Emily, the mother who disappeared, and Sean, Emily's husband.  The first really disappointing feature in the novel is that all three characters sound exactly alike.  Since there is very little dialogue, there is little opportunity to give them differences in their ways of communication.  All three sound the same.  All three run on, saying whatever pops into their heads - digressing - and making each of their chapters sound more like a journal or diary account.<br \/><br \/>Second, particularly annoying are Stephanie's blogs.  It's beyond belief that a friend, before police are called, and an investigation is in place, would blog out all the details and invite phone calls of sightings, while at the same time interspersing personal thoughts, and feelings with random ramblings - those blogs are a mess!<br \/><br \/>Third, is the lack of likability of the characters - who seem cold, distracted and sometimes, unfeeling.  How are we supposed to have the warm, fuzzies for them, if there is nothing there to like.  As a reader, it's always satisfying to find at least one character you can fall into line with!<br \/><br \/>Perhaps all my negative comments are just due to my lack of appreciation for a fresh, new writing style.  One reviewer has commented that the novel is &#34;brilliantly structured&#34; - and I find no fault with the structure.  It is the page after page of sameness in the outpourings of the three characters that was so readily apparent - and made for an uncomfortable reading experience.<br \/><br \/>I wish the author all the best with what sounds like an epic beginning of a writing career.  I'll be following it with interest, and hoping that I am in the minority of readers who could only give the novel two stars for its fresh premise.","images":[],"asin":"0062497774","parent_asin":"0062497774","user_id":"AG5FGCIM6PBJX3JNDRKQMITZTIMA","timestamp":1495949908000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2299,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Mildly entertaining, maybe a 2.5.","text":"Nathan Drake made a pledge to his father shortly before his death. He would take care of his mother and his brother at all costs. Joining the army to insure that he could provide for his family, he finds himself in the middle of some \"scary situations\" while protecting his country. Finding out that his brother, who has a genius IQ but not a lot of common sense is in danger and needs him to come home, Nathan sets out on a journey that will change his life forever. Two years later, we find Nathan in jail (he took the place of his twin brother) and reeling from the news that his brother was murdered. Who and why his brother was killed fuels Nathan on a path of vengeance and violence. He will stop at nothing to solve his brother's murder. That is until he met Terri Mitchell. Terri is a true survivor. She survived the murder of her mother, the murder of her partner, and a painful injury that she received the night her partner died. She also plans to survive the dent an investigation into the death will make on her career. Determined to bring down the drug dealer who she believes killed her partner, and follow all the leads no matter where they go, Terri joins BAD (Bureau of American Defense) and consults with the New Orleans Police Department. Soon we find them both knee deep in biological welfare, a stolen shipment of goods, counter agents with an agenda, and a secret organization bent on taking over the world. While I found this book mildly entertaining and a quick read, I also felt that some things could have been better, and struggle with what to give this novel. And while I did enjoy seeing some of the standard BAD characters (Joe, Tee and Carlos), and I liked Nathan and Stoner, I felt that there could have been a little more of something to really make this story great. I am just not sure what it could have been.","images":[],"asin":"B000UZQJKK","parent_asin":"B000UZQJKK","user_id":"AEGYU6OM2X66SMZN6AF3TSQ3N5PQ","timestamp":1255540505000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1845,"length_group":3}

Lance as this wandering dungeon diver with \"absorption\" abilities had a ton of power.<br \/><br \/>So, the only solution was to create even more powerful enemies and rip the entire city of Neo-Chicago from the surface of the planet.  Now Azaria must exercise even more power, and Lance's ever increasing abilities dwarf those of any other being on the planet.<br \/><br \/>I wanted to vomit.  I hate this kind of writing.  This story ran straight into one of my biggest complaints in that too much power was handed out to the \"heroes\" which resulted in the villains having to be far too powerful as well and the plot becomes a mess in seconds.<br \/><br \/>This story was very much a problem of a like v like conflict where the original side was already overpowered.  In a clash of titans, you end up with the monsters fighting blindly while flattening the world around them.  (think Godzilla v any monster in the older Kaiju films from Japan.  The humans are mere spectators as entire cities get stomped on.)<br \/><br \/>I don't like this kind of story.  It works with Godzilla because of the nature of the tale.  Godzilla is not really a character, but rather a force of the plot that moves around and guides the story as the humans who are the real characters must react to him.  In this series of Doll Dungeon, Azaria is clearly thought of as a major character, but she's too powerful to really be one.  And her dungeon is not a factor.  She does use her powers to protect Neo-Chicago, but we actually never get to see much of her third floor.<br \/><br \/>I just didn't care for this tale and by the time Azaria is marshalling her forces to assault another dungeon I had lost interest.

You don't get any deeper into the characters than that--they're all very superficial. By the end of A WRINKLE IN TIME I feel I know each of the Murry family members (even Sandy and Dennys, who only have a small role); in this book the characters are like paper.

The barely-there mystery plot isn’t capable of sustaining the novel.  The author has great credentials as a travel writer--so the details about the setting and people ring true--but the author lacks the storyteller’s gift.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, a teenaged surfer’s body is found floating in a Maui cove.

{"rating":2,"title":"Monkeewrench Team Solves Another Crime With Computer Magic","text":"For some reason, I can never warm to the Monkeewrench gang.  They’re the sorta-genius misfits who’ve formed Monkeewrench Software, and apparently you need to start with the early books to appreciate the personalities.  The three series novels that I’ve read are all police procedurals involving crimes that get solved with the aid of the extraordinary, almost magical, research capabilities of the Monkeewrench computer experts.<br \/><br \/>In ICE COLD HEART: A MONKEEWRENCH NOVEL, a woman is found murdered in a bondage situation--suffocated by duct tape wound around her head.  The victim was married and well off; soon it becomes clear that she was involved in some sort of consensual relationship with her killer.<br \/><br \/>As things develop, a picture emerges of a cruel serial killer with an ice cold heart.  By the end of the book, the detectives and the Monkeewrench crew are engaged in a race against time to save the lives of two additional women who’ve crossed paths with the killer.<br \/><br \/>The book is well written, but the plot is thin. Much of the “story” is about the interpersonal relationships of the established characters, and about the amazing computer research performed.  Since I don’t particularly care about any of the characters, and since I am no longer awed by research feats accomplished with computers, I thought the novel was slow-moving and boring.  It was kind of all downhill after the opening few chapters and the crime scene.","images":[],"asin":"1643851322","parent_asin":"1643851322","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1577854856287,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1464,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Disappointing!","text":"This was my first Lori Foster novel, and I fear my last. What started out as an interesting premise (human trafficking), ended up falling a little flat for me. I didn't even find the characters to be endearing or likable, with the exception of Rowdy, who could at times be a little irritating.  In the end, what I expected to be a suspense novel filled with a little romance, turned out to be a story that at times seemed forced and silly.<br \/><br \/>Alice Appleton is Detective Reese Bareden's neighbor, and when a group of thugs enter his home and hold him hostage (along with some of his co-workers), she doesn't flinch and comes to the rescue.  Reese is grateful, but begins to wonder who his neighbor really is and what secret(s) is she hiding? It's obvious that she has a past, and one that she isn't too anxious to share. Wanting to discover the truth, and possibly get in her pants, Reese sets out know, protect and love Alice, even if he has to use her love for his sweet dog (Cash) to do it. So while they navigate their budding romance, each learning to trust the other, they must determine who is behind the sale of women in their city.<br \/><br \/>As I write this review, I try to determine what was in about this novel that I didn't like. Was it that Reese was supposedly the only person who could see the \"real\" Alice, even before the makeover (done by Pepper)? Was it the corny part in the story when Alice, armed with a stun gun and a kick butt attitude, takes matters into her own hands and rescues one of the tattooed women? Or was it the whole concept behind Reese? While he should have been the whole package (sexy, hot, loyal and zealous), he was just typical and kind of irritating with all of the macho talk and over-protectiveness. Or was it the irritating things that he did like walking the dog without his shirt? Or it could have been the ridiculous dialog and conversations between the characters (Rowdy, Pepper, Logan) that seemed childish? At times it seemed so forced and juvenile, that it made reading this book a chore. Ironically, even the human trafficking storyline didn't help move this story along, probably because there was so much emphasis placed on Alice's past and her insecurities about her relationship with Reese, that it faded in the background. Anyway, a book that normally shouldn't have taken a few days to read took over a week. It was really difficult for me to get through. I give it 2 stars.","images":[],"asin":"0373777612","parent_asin":"0373777612","user_id":"AEGYU6OM2X66SMZN6AF3TSQ3N5PQ","timestamp":1379905300000,"helpful_vote":10,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2445,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"so much thrown at you it bogs down the story","text":"This is the second magic-based fantasy book I've read lately, and it really makes me want to give the other one a better review - in that one I felt that more could have been done with the magic, but wow, now I feel the other author showed a wonderful sense of restraint. In The Last Days of Magic... well, to be quite honest, I feel as if I've been bludgeoned by an overwhelming sense of things - this book is just trying too hard. Which is a shame, you can tell the author was really trying here, he had some good ideas and did his research, it just comes across as all thrown into the book as if you're trying to clean out the fridge and just dump whatever's still good into the pot on the stove without a care for how it'll taste. You have your Sidhe (fairies), you have your half-Sidhe, you have your Nephilim, your demons, your druids, your Church, your medieval kings and your Vikings... yeah, you have a lot going on here, and most of the time it comes across as rather info-dumpy at that - and a dry, historical book type of info-dump. You also have time jumps, things going back and forth in time perspectives, which doesn't help.<br \/>All of this might have been more bearable if I liked the characters, but all of that jumping around and the huge cast doesn't help to build much of a connection with them, and there's not much of an emotional depth to many of them, too. Perhaps it's the writing style, perhaps it's all the background information getting in the way, but I didn't connect to any of them.<br \/>So, there's some interesting twists on history and mythology here in this book, it's just burdened with too much plot and exposition in my opinion. If the story is continued, I truly hope the author is reined in and streamlines the plot while adding a bit more emotional depth to the characters (and no, that doesn't mean giving them more bland sex lives - among the rather graphic details of how brutal life could be in the medieval ages, there are scenes of rape in this book, albeit not very detailed, along with questionable coercion).","images":[],"asin":"0525429530","parent_asin":"0525429530","user_id":"AEEHSGIEOXLHDMNDUYGX4R4W5TZA","timestamp":1452633130000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2060,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Another Ordinary Attorney-Turned-Novelist Effort","text":"THE HEAVENS MAY FALL is a legal procedural novel that violates the basic &#34;show don't tell&#34; rule of fiction writing--there's far too much &#34;tell&#34;.  The novel opens on the 4th anniversary of the death (in an unsolved hit-run &#34;accident&#34;) of Detective Max Rupert's wife (Jenni).  Rupert is still &#34;torn apart&#34; by memories of her.  As the novel progresses, the reader is repeatedly reminded of Rupert's love for Jenni via his internal soliloquies.  There are also many passages explaining points of law and legal ethics that are NOT particularly well-integrated into the narrative.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, Rupert is called to investigate a crime scene in an upscale neighborhood--a woman's naked body, wrapped in a child's blanket (patterned with horses and stars), has been discovered in a parking lot.  Rupert quickly identifies the woman through a brand on her 2-carat diamond stud earrings.  She is Jennavieve Pruitt, wife of attorney Ben Pruitt.<br \/><br \/>Rupert hates Pruitt for sullying his reputation in open court in an earlier homicide case.  Pruitt tried to introduce a forged document that said Rupert had been reprimanded for falsifying evidence.  Pruitt claimed he didn't know the document was forged, and was formally reprimanded for his action, but the jury heard about the document.<br \/><br \/>Because of that history, Rupert's money is on Pruitt as the killer, even though Pruitt was out of town at the time of the murder. Pruitt engages law professor Boady Sanden--a personal friend of both Rupert and Pruitt--as his defense attorney.  Sanden, who is haunted by his memories of a failed defense of an innocent man, believes in Pruitt's innocence as strongly as Rupert believes in Pruitt's guilt.  It's up to both Sanden and Rupert to discover the truth.<br \/><br \/>The writing is stiff, and the characters aren't particularly well-developed or appealing.  Again, there is too much &#34;tell&#34;--it gets in the way of identifying with the characters.  The plot has a few surprising twists, but it bored me.  The ending, while NOT a cliffhanger, prepares the way for the next series novel.  The title is taken from a legal maxim, translated from Latin as &#34;Do justice though the heavens may fall&#34;.  Because this novel struck me as another very ordinary attorney-turned-novelist effort, I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1633882055","parent_asin":"1633882055","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1477151453000,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2417,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Spirits Out of Time","text":"&#34;The Folk of the Air&#34; is a story whose background details are more interesting than what is supposed to be the plot driver.  Beagle starts out playing around with a whimsical take on the feminist goddess idea of the mid-80s, then gets involved in cosplay, relationships, petty ambition etc; he develops the narrative out of that and, unwilling or able to let go of the ideas he started with and unable to pull the disparate strands together, he seems to have wound up just ending it all SOMEHOW to move on.  I found many of the ideas interesting, but the central conceit simply doesn't work here, and it all ends in disappointing incoherence.<br \/><br \/>The story is set about ten years after the '60s.  Rootless musician Joe Farrell has returned to his old college town to visit his best friend Ben, who is now a professor there.  Ben is in a relationship with a mysterious older woman named Sia, a counsellor of disquieting insight and strange power.  Farrell finds that the local scene has transformed from people performing the various personas of the counterculture to day-job people devoting their personal lives to a pseudonymic version of the SCA, a cosplay organization devoted to medieval-style fantasy, in which Ben is a Viking warrior.  Farrell finds that the situation works for him, and hooks up with an on-again-off-again old flame who is also a member.  Unfortunately the teenage daughter of one of the cosplayers is a developing witch who wants to rule the organization; she calls up a powerful spirit with an inimical relationship with Sia, and cosplayers become collateral damage as magic turns fantasy into people's real lives.<br \/><br \/>To me the most interesting aspect of the story is how invented personas allow people dissatisfied with their day jobs to create an alternate reality, and the complex costs of maintaining it.  Unfortunately this idea has nothing to do with the plot, which toys idly with a conception of the goddess and climaxes in an unconvincingly invented mother-son relationship.<br \/><br \/>Beagle's language is clever, all but one or two of the characters are well-drawn, and there are side issues of some interest.  I hear he he is thinking about revisiting this material; there's a lot of potential here for a better story.","images":[],"asin":"0345337824","parent_asin":"0345337824","user_id":"AG6GPIKENPZRBMYKTGNF46XUN7FA","timestamp":1495813304000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2279,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Not your typical vampire story, but also not for me","text":"Vampire Huntress is not your typical vampire book written by Rosemary Johns. The plot is not very straight forward and I struggled quite a bit trying to figure out what the author was trying to convey with this story. It seemed very aimless for quite a while but mostly focused on Violet meeting Rebel and realizes she is not WHAT she thought she is and is trying to figure out what she is but is not getting any answers. I admit I really struggled with this book a lot. It is very violent, but in an odd way that, where Violet goes from 0 to 100 in no time just to go back to 0 just as quickly. There just doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for a lot of her actions. I understand anger and frustration, but her actions just don't seem to make sense.<br \/>Rebel on the other hand is a somewhat man-child who on some occassions is definitely a full blown adult yet on others you are not sure if he acts older than a young child, and I mean that literally in both actions and how he talks. It is beyond confusing. It is confusing on where he stands on what he means pretty much all of the time.<br \/><br \/>Ash is probably the only straight forward character besides the &#34;bad guys&#34; and him I actually liked quite a bit. I can't really say I liked the &#34;bad guys&#34; which I am not really sure who that all entails since as I said this plot is confusing and the lines are not clearly drawn.<br \/><br \/>The author also seems to try to make an intricate plot but instead leaves more of a mess in my eyes. It takes a long time to make clear what the differences of vampires, the fallen vs angels are and even now I am not fully sure that I have it right and what the point of it all is. I admit this book is not for me, maybe it is just too complicated for me and I don't  understand it enough to fully appreciate it.<br \/><br \/> Voluntary review of Advance Reader Copy.

{"rating":2,"title":"So disappointed. I kind of wish that I had not read it. 2","text":"For months, I have been struggling with my decision not to read the last book in the trilogy surrounding the life and times of forensic sculptor Eve Duncan. Having read some of Eve's stories in the past, I too was invested in discovering what happened to her beloved child (missing and presumed dead) Bonnie. Over the years I have witnessed Eve's painstaking efforts to bring her own child's remains home while helping other families find peace. However, after reading \"Eve\" and \"Quinn\", I wasn't sure I wanted or needed to know the truth, which is bad since I was supposedly invested in the characters and storyline.<br \/><br \/>First criticism: Why did it take three books to unravel the complicated but bizarre but obvious truth surrounding Bonnie's death? To me, this story could have been told in one well written and concise book. Iris Johansen stretched it (a bit thin at times) with tons of complicated relationships and red herrings. From the beginning (of the trilogy), I could see the complicated pattern of a mystery forming that was, in my opinion, pointless.<br \/><br \/>Second: The evolution of Eve. I really stopped feeling sorry for Eve half-way thru the trilogy. While I totally sympathize with the loss of her child, and celebrate her determination\/dedication to bring other children home while searching for the answer to her own questions concerning Bonnie's disappearance, by the time I read this book, I didn't really like her anymore. To me she seemed at times selfish and whiny. No matter how much Bonnie told her that \"it wasn't her time\", or to \"move beyond her death\", Eve constantly tries to hasten the end of her life, regardless of her love for Joe or Jane (her adopted \"artist\" daughter, who is only mentioned briefly, almost like an after- thought, in this book). And yet everyone, and I mean everyone (Catherine, Gallo, Joe, etc.) is risking their lives to rescue Eve and give her the answers she needs.<br \/><br \/>Third: Character development. Catherine Ling, who while I do agree should feel some debt to Eve for bringing her kidnapped son home, is willing to risk everything - travel around the world (ok, Georgia in this book) - to give Eve some closure. She even leaves her beloved son, who was just returned to her with Eve's help, behind to follow clues in the Bonnie murder investigation. Meanwhile, she even fights her attraction to Gallo, Eve's old lover\/Bonnie's father, if it will affect her relationship with Eve. Furthermore, she is ven willing to risk her career with the CIA (going rogue at times or off the reservation) to give Eve the answers she so desires. Then there is Joe, who is a promising detective in Atlanta but due to his love of Eve has taken a hiatus to assist in the investigation. And poor John Gallo, who has experienced every atrocity imaginable, from child abuse to being a prisoner of war, is so confused about his feelings about Eve, Catherine and Bonnie, that he seems to brood and be moody most of the time. But he too is driven to discover the elusive truth no matter  the consequences. Not to mention he is constantly fighting his attraction to the lethal Catherine. Perhaps the biggest transformation was in Bonnie herself, who appeared to Eve, Joe, Catherine and John as a child (in her Bugs Bunny t-shirt), but had very adult conversations, sounding and acting far older than her 7 years.<br \/><br \/>Fourth: The Mystery itself. At the end of the book, when the events leading to Bonnie's death are revealed, I wasn't really surprised. Instead I felt cheated and somewhat saddened that that was all there was to it. I would have expected, with all of the red herrings throughout the series, for there to be just a little something more, but there wasn't. And while I know most crimes, especially murders, are that simple, why even go thru the whole espionage storyline. It just felt wrong.<br \/><br \/>Now let me focus on the good things about the story....<br \/><br \/>Well I think Johansen did a decent job with the paranormal (i.e., ghost or supernatural) aspect of the story. While it did seem forced at times (i.e., long talks with Bonnie....who no longer sounded like a child but a wise adult), at least provided some depth to the story. Bonnie's constant presence provided just the right amount of mystery. And while there were some times that I would scratch my head....because I was torn between Johansen wanting to remake \"The Lovely Bones\" or \"What Dreams May Come\", I at least appreciated her attempts to introduce another element into the story.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I probably would have been just as happy not knowing the truth BUT now I can at least say that I did read the entire trilogy. Would I read another Eve Duncan, forensic sculptor extraordinaire, book? Probably not for awhile.","images":[],"asin":"B007SRW2FO","parent_asin":"B007SRW2FO","user_id":"AEGYU6OM2X66SMZN6AF3TSQ3N5PQ","timestamp":1351612135000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4776,"length_group":3}

Some animals get their own chapter but it's only a few pages (bats - 6 pages, deer - 4 pages). There's zero standardization of what info is given  - it'd be better if it were either a light overview or an in-depth reference instead of a bizarre and frustrating mash-up. There's nothing for felines, mustelids (except badgers), racoons, opossums, etc. I bought it to reference for Wildlife Rehabilitation but it's just too hit-or-miss to be generally useful.... but I'm sure I'll get some use out of it anyways.<br \/><br \/>It's worth pointing out (because it's not obvious on the Amazon page) this book is written for the UK, not USA.

I adore his charming personality and his quick wit, and I wish him all the best life has to offer.  I will always cherish when I actually got to meet him during his Borders tour in November of 2007.  I consider myself extremely lucky to actually meet one of my idols.<br \/><br \/>That being said, I am sad that, with regard to my opinion of \"Secret Codes and Battleships\", I am not in the majority.  While I do respect how much work he has put into the album and how important it is to him, it feels like a step backward, musically speaking.  When I bought \"This Delicate Thing We've Made\", it accompanied me on every lunch break spent in my car in 2007\/2008.  I was sure that SCBS would enjoy the same longevity, considering the fact that Darren is back on a major label and was incorporating such elements as an orchestra and big-name producers, yet I was rather disappointed with it.  His mainstream pop lyrics are not as poignant as are his indie-pop lyrics, with the exception of \"Black Out the Sun\", and if I could sum up the album in a word, I would use \"fluff\".  This record did not resonate with me as strongly as the rest of his catalog has, and after reading many people's reviews of how they enjoy the originality, I fail to see it.  I never thought Darren could disappoint me, but then I guess he wrote \"Hero\" (from Tension and the Spark) for a reason.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line: Love Darren, love his catalog, but this one let me down.

Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment--the story is told from multiple viewpoints (central character Clare, Clare’s diaries, detective Harbinder, Clare’s daughter Georgia, the narrator of a Gothic short story), and the plot clues and developments are dribbled out ever so slowly.  Overall, the novel is a confusing mess that isn’t worth the effort of piecing it all together.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, a teacher at a private girls' school (Ella) is murdered during half-term break.  Ella’s murder promotes the chief narrator and diarist (Clare) to Ella’s position of teaching older students.  During half-term, Clare is teaching a course that includes a Gothic short story (“The Stranger” by the fictional author R.M Holland).  Clare becomes a suspect in Ella’s murder and also in subsequent murders tied to a haunted room in the girls’ school.<br \/><br \/>What is extremely mysterious, is that Clare keeps finding entries in her private diaries that appear to be written by the killer.  The problem is, how did the killer gain access?  The Gothic story is itself a mystery, and it is revealed in small segments (though the whole thing is available at the end of the book).  Clare’s daughter Georgia is placed in danger, as is the family dog (Herbert).  Throughout the novel, Clare’s stability and sanity is in doubt.<br \/><br \/>The best thing about this novel is probably the Gothic short story (“The Stranger”), which truly captures the mood and language of a 19th century horror story.

{"rating":2,"title":"Very, very similar to the Generations trilogy, but falls short.","text":"I wanted to love this book. I love the genres of sci-fi, adventure and survival, so this book should have ticked all the boxes for me. Yet.... I kept thinking &#34;I've read this story before&#34; and getting distracted.<br \/><br \/>Last night it finally clicked. This is very, very similar to Scott Sigler's Alive trilogy. Teenagers lost in space after a ship crashes, scary unknown bad guys and adults vanishing, one kid who tries to grow into the leader, mysterious alien technology, alien creatures and life forms on a hostile planet - both books share the same, basic major plot points. Seriously, read Alive and Awake by Sigler and then read this. Sigler did it first and he did it better.<br \/><br \/>The story moves quickly, yet still bogs down with the incessant inner dialogue of Jonah and his self doubt. There is also a certain sense of chaos from the first few pages that is appropriate to the things going on, but that never really stops. I felt like the author kept introducing new kids, new tools and new directions without following through with adequate motivation for the characters.

{"rating":2,"title":"UFR Reviews The Traitors Daughter","text":"I really like the cover for this book, and I have to admit it did attract me, and made me want to find out more about the actual content of the book. The book blurb wasn't the most intriguing blurb I have ever read before but it had enough of pull for me to want to try it out.<br \/><br \/>Regardless of what I was expecting, this book was not at all my kind of book. To begin it started off kind of bizarrely. It started off with what I assume was suppose to be one part humorous and one part background information that would want the reader to want to know more. I'm not sure it accomplished either. The man it starts out with has built an automaton and this, essentially clone, believes he is superior to the man who built him. He is demanding, short, and arrogant. I think his offhand comments are intended to be humorous, and maybe they would have been if the situation itself hadn't been so confusing.<br \/><br \/>From there it immediately leaves that scene, which is somewhat jarring, and then turns to what appears to be some kind of political power struggle between families who are always vying for power over each other. My first real bone to pick, is the author is constantly introducing new places and people, and they all have completely unpronounced names, which makes it hard to remember who is who. So by the end of the first chapter, I was decently confused as to what was going on and what was the point of it all.<br \/><br \/>The writing style in general was fairly unimaginative, and did nothing to really draw me into what was going on. I wish I could give specific reasons as to what with the writing style was not appealing, all I know is that about a quarter of the way through the book, I really wanted to stop reading.<br \/><br \/>I struggled to find any characters I could really pull for or identify with. Jianna is probably the character who came closest to me liking, but fell short. Jianna is pulled from her sheltered life into a bad situation early on in the book, and in other books where a main character is kidnapped or something similar, I almost always feel myself pulling for that character, this was not the case with Jianna. I mean I felt bad for her, but her reactions were not organic, and because I didn't really believe in the character it was hard for me to want to pull for her or have empathy for her.<br \/><br \/>Perhaps there is an audience for this book, I suppose it leans more towards sci fi than historical fantasy. Honestly it reads more like a political thriller with bizarre magical elements thrown in for kicks. This is not a book for the urban fantasy fan, nor a book for anyone looking for romance.","images":[],"asin":"0553583808","parent_asin":"0553583808","user_id":"AG3XIAIYKMMG356ZP2UJ4RFQTJJA","timestamp":1322724685000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2655,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Not worth the money","text":"This is a short book with about 18 illustrated exercises for the therapeutic use of a [[ASIN:B0026I2SBS foam roller]] to stretch muscles and massage them. I believe it is not worth spending money to purchase this book for several reasons:<br \/><br \/>1. You can find all of these exercises and more, for free, on YouTube and around the Internet.<br \/>2. If you are not fit, limber, and without current or past hard- or soft-tissue injury, it is unlikely that you will be able to do these foam-roller exercises without causing your body additional, unwanted, pain-inducing muscle strain.<br \/><br \/>Let me give myself as an example of my claim: I meet the requirements for being fit and limber, but I continue to deal with the fallout of a car accident from over 20 years ago, which has caused my mid-back to have a strong tendency to far-too-easily go into painful spasm. In particular, this tends to happen if I do not support my neck when doing floor exercises, such as the ones required to use a foam roller. I have been unable to do any of the exercises in this book (or any other foam-roller exercises I discovered on the Internet) while simultaneously supporting my neck.<br \/><br \/>In addition, the exercises themselves, which are touted to be relaxing to muscles, require a ridiculous amount of tensile and contractile muscle strength in order to roll the body back and forth across the roller. Though I have strong stomach and back muscles from daily exercise, I could not roll my body back and forth on my roller per these exercises without feeling I was causing far more strain than relaxation gain, and I cannot imagine how injured, feeble, or disabled individuals could gain any muscle stretch or relaxation from any of these exercises.<br \/><br \/>In short, the touted benefits of using a roller for stretching and massaging one's muscles is bogus. The whole goal of stretching and massaging is to relax muscles, and it is impossible to achieve if the method employed involves forcing a huge percentage of the muscles in the body to tense in order to shove the body back and forth across a foam roller.<br \/><br \/>Even trying to use the roller up against a wall instead of laid on the floor did not fix the inherent problems with these exercises for me. While it did improve my ability to support my neck, I still had to use a great deal of muscle strength in order to shove the roller back and forth between my body and the wall, and the roller would frequently slip and fall to the ground.<br \/><br \/>I also tried to use my foam roller for the [[ASIN:0062065351 The MELT Method]], and it was just as much a problem for me doing those exercises, which also resulted in neck and back strain.<br \/><br \/>Ultimately, the only useful purpose I have found for my 6-inch-by-36-inch, firm, foam roller is one recommended by my acupuncturist, which allows actual, comfortable stretching and relaxation of muscles. He said to turn the roller perpendicular to my spine, place it just below the bottom of my ribs, and lie on it. This creates a gentle stretch to the back muscles that is extremely relaxing, especially when combined with deep breathing. And for me personally, this effective technique has made an amazing difference in preventing back pain due to muscle spasms.","images":[],"asin":"0984372431","parent_asin":"0984372431","user_id":"AHW7ETGBKGX6DCG2LBAG5YAXU46A","timestamp":1398051497000,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3279,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Pure Extreme-Feminist Fantasy","text":"Vigilante justice is seldom admirable, and I really dislike the “Sisterhood” vigilantes.  NEED TO KNOW is like “The First Wives Club” (which I happen to love) on steroids.  The sisters have a dark viciousness about them—laughing and giggling about all the bad things they are going to do to their chosen target—that cancels out for me any sense that they are working for good. The “Lady Justice” that they all salute whenever they enter their underground “war room” is ill-served by these women.<br \/><br \/>WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH:  The plot is cynical in the extreme—the unlimited funds available to the sisters permit them to break any and all laws, including those against spy surveillance, kidnapping, blackmail, and torture, without being concerned about possible consequences.  For example, to get privileged information about their target (an evil, money-grubbing man), one sister who is a lawyer visits another lawyer’s office and lies about her “client’s” intentions—a major violation of her profession’s ethical rules against pretexting\/dissembling, fraud, dishonesty, and deceit by lawyers.  As another example, while obtaining signatures on court documents by duress, two of the most respectable, loaded-with-money sisters actually sign their real names to the documents as witnesses without  worrying that their identities can be traced to the criminal circumstances surrounding the signings.  Their money insulates them, and provides the answer to everything.<br \/><br \/>This series novel (which works fine as a standalone) is pure extreme-feminist fantasy.  The sisters and their contacts are women of great power and influence—a countess who has almost all the money in the world; a lawyer who has recently been named “Lawyer of the Year”; a former major newspaper editor-in-chief; a former Supreme Court justice who has resigned to do good for abused wives and children; a garden nursery owner; a world-famous, widely adored, popular singer.  As for the men in the sisters’ lives—they adore the women, do the women’s bidding without question, and perform all the cooking and cleaning tasks.  Even the watchdogs are female—a mother and her pups.<br \/><br \/>If you like this sort of escapist fiction, and don’t mind the amorality of the characters, then you will like this book.  It’s not my cup of tea, but I recognize that the writing and plotting are professional.","images":[],"asin":"1420140698","parent_asin":"1420140698","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1518121613602,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2403,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Hard Review to Write...","text":"I desperately hoped this would be all I had heard from reviews of the Broadway play, but sadly, it was not.  As a disclaimer, I have not seen the play, but have heard the basic premise.  I was excited to read this novel and to place it in my classroom library (which I still intend to do); however, the way the story of Evan Hansen unfolded, I just felt was too overdramatized and offered little help, with plenty of excuses and rationale for making mistakes with dire consequences.<br \/><br \/>The basic premise of the novel centers on our main character, Evan Hansen, who suffers from a myriad of mental health issues, including anxiety and depression.  His feelings of helplessness and an inability to make friends isolates him in the story, and we go along with him as he tries to interact in a world where he feels in danger.  A letter that he wrote to himself, meant to share with his therapist, gets into the hands of a young man who has picked on Evan.  Later that night, the young man commits suicide and the family believes the letter he had, that Evan wrote, was actually written by their son TO Evan.  This is the pivotal moment in the story where Evan fails to clear up this mix-up and goes along with their understanding.<br \/><br \/>The premise to this point was pretty good, and I felt great empathy for Evan.  The thing I found disconcerting and strange, however, was the lying that continued throughout the novel.  I needed to understand more about this compulsion to hide or cover up the truth.  In a lot of ways, it just seemed unclear and was pawned off as being part of his mental health issues that drove him.  As someone who has family member with some of these mental health issues, I can't say that his reactions felt familiar to me or felt authentic.  In fact, I simply felt that this was speaking to the core of Evan and not to those suffering from these mental health problems.  It is to this issue, being Evan's character and not his illnesses that I struggled with.  In some ways, I felt the novel was trying to suppose that it is natural for those with mental health issues to make HUGE mistakes, when in reality, they might do that, but that is not a \"norm\" across the board.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I just couldn't get behind the story.  The rushed ending, the shallow \"fixes,\" and the resolutions in the end all left me feeling overwhelmingly negative toward Evan and all those who brushed aside his actions.  I didn't expect for Evan to be strung up for his mistakes, rather, I wanted a more honest narrative that didn't place all of his actions on the shoulders of his mental health issues.  I was left feeling empty, not truly understanding what helped him to change, nor how he went from the struggling teen at the beginning of the novel to the somewhat insightful young man at the end.  Evan just needed a bit more development to make sense.","images":[],"asin":"0316420239","parent_asin":"0316420239","user_id":"AH74XLC3QBXVC6UCOAQOJH3WJYGA","timestamp":1539623491003,"helpful_vote":18,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2875,"length_group":3}

{"rating":2,"title":"Maybe No One Proofread This Book for Content and Consistency","text":"I was disappointed with Jock Brogas’s undisciplined writing, making it difficult to understand or keep up with the messages that he’s trying to share with his readers. It’s also unclear if this book was written for a beginner or for one who already knows something about martial arts and subscribes to the premise that our minds and spirit are the fundamental forces that fuel and guide the practitioner of such arts. To add insult to injury, the author speckles the reading with Japanese words, some of which are defined or explained and others are not.<br \/>In the beginning the book starts like a fictional novel about a psychic guy (the author) who arrives at a martial arts school in Japan where fellow students don’t personally know him, but they’ve heard that there is a psychic guest among them. He’s allegedly the anticipated guest, who keeps his identity a secret from the others. The contradiction soon follows in that, just like the other students, he’s there to be tested for his psychic abilities. Hence, he’s nothing special, just another guy who’s there to be tested. Without any fanfare or reasonable sequence of events, he’s the only one who passes the test and is hailed by the audience of teachers and onlookers. The events and woven Japanese words are as exciting and enlightening as watching paint dry. Then the book’s genre changes to a nonfiction tutorial and\/or reference with additional flecks of Japanese words.<br \/>Around page 28, the author tosses in an anecdote about his friend Ed Martin. Maybe he should have started the book with that account, which is about how Ed’s intuition or inner voice warned him that he was about to have a heart attack while he was enjoying a daily bike ride. After that, the writer gives two more short anecdotes, a brief history and description of ninjas, and lists the nine or so ninja schools that allegedly exist today. The chapters that follow give definitions, examples, and suggestions that deal with meditation, the chakras and their respective lights, and how to ground yourself for the suggested meditation exercises. The exercises will allegedly improve or awaken your psychic abilities and make you a better martial arts’ warrior if you don’t die of boredom from this tedious read.

{"rating":2,"title":"(Sigh) I should have loved it. 2-2.5 stars","text":"I personally enjoy reading supernatural or paranormal stories. If there is a witch, ghost, vampire, werewolf or fae, in the story, I'm game to read it. And while I really should have loved this story, I thought it was just ok. There was everything that should have made this story great.....vampires, hunters, Nazi experiments, some romance and a hunt , but it just never came together for me. I mean really come together in that way that made me think....I want to read the sequel. Instead, it just fell a little flat and in the end I just kind of closed it and picked up another book to read. I didn't stop and ponder, nor did I see when the next one would be released or look to see what other books were available by the author.<br \/><br \/>The plot was ok, although not too original. Claire, a reporter is trying to determine what is behind her sister, Amanda's, most recent mental breakdown. Amanda is in a hospital and believes (telling everyone she encounters) that a vampire has been feeding from her. Of course no one believes her, especially her sister until she sees some very curious things. Meanwhile she encounters a number of people who not only believe Amanda, but seem to have some ideas on the subject themselves. Enters, George, who not only knows that vampires exist, but may be the very hybrid that vampire hunters,  possibly dispatched by the Vatican or some other clandestine organization, have been searching for. So when Claire and George go on the run, they attempt to outrun those meaning to capture them. And while Claire doesn't entirely trust George or his motives, he is able to fill in holes in the information that she has been given thus far. It seems George has a story that he doesn't mind sharing and she is willing to listen, especially if it will help her understand what is happening to her sister. As they learn more about each other, they must also elude those (Whitman & Bishop) who are trying to capture or even kill them. And sandwiched between the hunt and the chase, is a little romance between George and Claire (yes, that too seemed a little forced...I guess we are to assume that every vampire is so irresistible that even when you are trying to stay alive, and prevent yourself from being killed, you have time to get busy....).<br \/><br \/>There were a few things that left me scratching my head......I didn't really understand Amanda's supposed hatred for Claire, nor did I understand George's feelings for Claire at the end. Some of the stuff just never came together. And while this could have been a great novel, it was just ok. However, I did love the short, easy to read chapters that usually ended with a cliffhanger. And while this did distract from the story at times, because it seemed a little forced, I tried to ignore it in case it was the result of being translated from another language. To me, ending each chapter in a \"tad a\" moment, took away from the final cliffhanger, that just kind of hung there....especially since I was never really invested in any of the characters (I was indifferent), and wasn't sure if I would want to read a sequel even if it was available. With that being said, I am sure that this is a story that some will enjoy, but it wasn't my cup of tea. I give it 2 to 2.5 stars.","images":[],"asin":"1477817468","parent_asin":"1477817468","user_id":"AEGYU6OM2X66SMZN6AF3TSQ3N5PQ","timestamp":1401212782000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3267,"length_group":3}

The crime also takes a decidedly back seat to her constant thoughts about protecting the two close family members who mean the world to her.  They, of course, think the husband is a terrific guy, and are unaware of the abuse.<br \/><br \/>As a mystery\/thriller, the novel falls short.  However, it seems accurate enough in portraying a woman who is trapped in an abusive marriage.  It isn't always so easy for a woman to call the cops on a husband, or simply to divorce him.  In my opinion, the value of this novel lies in its food for thought:  Does the abuse inflicted on the heroine by her controlling, abusive husband justify the heroine's choice of escape route?  Could she have done anything else?  Should she be forgiven?<br \/><br \/>I ordered this book as a mystery\/thriller, and was disappointed when (1) it turned out to be women's literary fiction, not general escape fiction; and (2) the prison setting seemed incidental to the overall plot.","images":[],"asin":"0316268763","parent_asin":"0316268763","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1500305088871,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1388,"length_group":3}

Mitch Byrd's \"Notes to Draw From\" is a better resource.<br \/><br \/>Klaus Janson has worked on some major DC titles and apparently also teaches at the School of Visual Arts.  Here he seems to be trying to pad out grudgingly little info on penciling with a sort of \"why comics require super skills to draw\" pedagogy that consumes more than 110 pages of an essentially 142-page book!<br \/><br \/>There's some good info in here I suppose, but the technical stuff always needs to be taken with a large block of salt.  No one ever became a great artist by studying art.  People become great artists by doing what they enjoy!  The way to become an artist is by creating art.  As you encounter challenges you look for solutions to problems and develop.  In that sense this book might be useful.  B-S- statements like \"Drawing... requires study\" etc etc do more harm than good IMHO.<br \/><br \/>The most important thing for would-be comics artists to remember is that the most successful guys in the field are Matt Groening and Scott Adams.

Over the years I have often thought of her works and have often given her books as gifts.  I have also read many of her books as they came out but missed this one until now.  I wish that I had just skipped this one.<br \/><br \/>The story focuses on Sandy and Dennys, the most normal members of the Murray family (WRINKLE IN TIME etc) the one who, even in the early books, were presented as the family members who kept the rest of the family grounded in reality.  We were told in the other books that the twins were not social outcasts in school like their sister and brother, and in a family filled with geniuses Sandy an Dennys were only considered bright, rather than gifted.  The rest of the family had all been involved in fantastic adventures but the twins had been mostly left behind.<br \/><br \/>This time though they are swept off to another time and place to face the unknown.  The boys accidentally get transported from their Connecticut home where they are wearily dragging through the last days of winter to a sun and sand filled desert where they are rescued by a group of strange people and creatures.  Gradually it becomes apparent to the boys that they have been transported to Old Testament times, and that the people who have saved them are Noah and his family.  The boys realize that the coming Flood will change forever the life in the oasis, and the rest of the world.  The question is will they manage to return to their home before it comes or will they be among those left outside the Ark to perish?<br \/><br \/>Like the other books in this Quintet this one has a marvelous setting, one that transports the reader to an exotic location filled with challenging concepts and characters.  Unlike the other books though that is just about all that this book supplies.  The method and reason for Sandy and Dennys to be transported is weak, their actions while they are there is confined to being hurt, being rescued, and running away.  The only real positive, active thing either boy performs in the whole story is to encourage a son to be nice to his father.  In the other books the main characters all undergo some significant growth but by the end of this story Sandy and Dennys are completely unaltered by their experiences, not even their physical appearances have changed.  The book might as well ended the novel with the cliched 'it was all a dream' device.","images":[],"asin":"0312368577","parent_asin":"0312368577","user_id":"AHXWUCTMVBQXDVMDFPA3NO43QF2Q","timestamp":1416503613000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2481,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"Do You Over- Consume?","text":"Excess consumption is a common occurrence in many western nations, especially in the United States. People are obsessed with the accumulation of merchandise and many will buy things, not because they really need them, but for some other superfluous reason, like keeping up with trends, keeping pace with the accumulation of others, etc. This obsession with owning and accumulating things is evident all around us, and while the recession has slowed the progress a little, it is still a widely agreed on fact that most of us purchase more than we need.<br \/><br \/>Give our penchant for overconsumption, it isn't surprising that some authors have chosen to publish books on this concern and The Story of Stuff is one such book. Author Annie Leonard has observed the accumulation of stuff all around her and she has seen the destruction that this obsession with stuff has had on the environment, on other countries, on health, etc. She is rightfully concerned that this accumulation of so much stuff is going to have long- lasting effects on the human race and the planet if nothing is done to reverse the trend.<br \/><br \/>The Story of Stuff makes some valid points throughout the book relating to stuff and how it impacts each and every one of us. The concerns about excess consumption are valid, and I like the book's proposal that recycling of waste would be best handled at the source instead of at the level of the consumer. The book is also correct in its assessment that excesses and wealth are not what makes most people happy and there is plenty of evidence to back up this and other claims. However, there are other aspects of this book that reduce its overall appeal and while I can certainly sympathize with the book's good intentions, the persuasive strategies it employs are not the best and individuals who support the book's basic philosophy will likely be disappointed that this book doesn't more effectively deliver on its promise. For instance, the book attempts at one point to argue against the need to have so many different consumer choices. People like having lots of choices, so a book must carefully articulate the reasons not to have a plethora of choices if it has any hope to convince the reader. But the best The Story of Stuff can do is claim that it is childish to want so many different choices and that having fewer, better options is more ideal. This rationale isn't going to be enough to persuade very many people. The same is true of the book's recommendation that we all try to purchase goods produced locally. This is a good idea, because it helps keep money local, but the book needs better and more compelling reasons to back its point of view. Admitting that, for example, fresh produce costs more at a local farmer's market but you get the joy of talking to a local farmer isn't going to convince many people to stop shopping at their local discount store, where they would pay less for the same items.<br \/><br \/>Another problem I have is the way the book is written. The book is grammatically correct for the most part, but the style is a little on the elementary side and the author talks to the reader like he\/she knows next to nothing about the subject matter at hand. I like that the author intertwines her own experiences throughout the book, and they include some good, eye- opening experiences living in poverty- stricken areas and highly polluted areas. However, she comes across as a little arrogant and preachy. Her point could have been made better with a different approach and more attention to practical, logical, reasons to support her point of view. Then, there is the problem with the book's solutions. Too often, it promotes government force as the only workable means to an end.<br \/><br \/>Materialism and living to excess is an important topic and The Story of Stuff is a book with a good premise and some valid observations. Unfortunately, the book's basic persuasive techniques are not very good and the author too frequently wants to resort to government force to make her will the law of the land. Those who already agree with the author's points will like the book and consider it preaching to the choir, but those who don't will not be persuaded to consider her opinions.","images":[],"asin":"143912566X","parent_asin":"143912566X","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1272393924000,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4240,"length_group":3}
{"rating":2,"title":"A poorly edited manuscript with minimal information on RA that made me sorry I purchased this","text":"I purchased this book along with [[ASIN:1421414279 Living with Rheumatoid Arthritis]] because I wanted to learn more about RA.<br \/><br \/>I like that this manuscript is short and touches on some RA symptoms, the importance of diet, etc. However, the main issue I have with this text is that it is POORLY written and POORLY edited. There was one sentence that just ended in the middle and the rest of the sentence was nowhere to be found. Another section mentioned &#34;Rolfing&#34; but said RA patients should NOT use this so it was not going to be discussed. In this case, the author should have at least written a sentence on what &#34;Rolfing&#34; is. (PS It is manipulation of the connective tissue; a type of massage.)  Also, after the first chapter every page had several formatting \/ editing errors such as no spaces between words, periods and commas where they don't belong, etc. The English is poor as well. I kept thinking this was the author's second language.<br \/><br \/>Had this not been so poorly written, I would have rated this three stars.

{"rating":2,"title":"Academic Description of Vertical \"Strata\" of Cities","text":"In the Introduction to VERTICAL: THE CITY FROM SATELLITES TO BUNKERS, author Stephen Graham observes that shortage of land results in increasingly dense and stacked human societies.  Thus, he says, any understanding of contemporary cities requires looking at their &quot;vertical geographies&quot; (from skyscrapers' sub-basements to their empty antenna-filled crowns), not merely at their &quot;horizontal geographies&quot; (as represented by skyscrapers' footprints as seen on flat maps).  Today, political struggles over urban development are now increasingly shaped across both vertical and horizontal geographies of power.<br \/><br \/>In the bulk of the book, Graham describes, at great length, the human and political aspects of the vertical strata of cities.  Satellites photograph the Earth's surface in astounding detail, causing political unrest in Bahrein when the impoverished majority sees the ruling majority's lavish homes on Google Earth.  Elevators shape interior building spaces as they evolve from cars placed within elevator shafts to exposed, glass-walled gondolas clinging to hotel lobby walls. Sewers hide &quot;the excretory nature underlying the city&quot;, and sewer construction must take into account special problems such as the solidified fat discharged by fast-food restaurants.<br \/><br \/>The book contains a wealth of contemporary historical fact related to the &quot;strata&quot; of cities (from the effects of the bombing of Dresden to the depiction of sewers as monster-filled in horror films).  However, I struggled to find any real theme or argument to this book.  If the book is taken as purely descriptive of the vertical, three-dimensional characteristics of cities and their buildings, then the author's convoluted, academic prose makes for extremely tough going.<br \/><br \/>Perhaps this is an important, must-read book for urban planners, and for political activists who oppose high-rise developments.  However, as a reader with only a casual interest in architecture and city planning, I rate the book at 2 stars (&quot;I don't like it&quot; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1781687935","parent_asin":"1781687935","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1474544961000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2115,"length_group":3}

Nicholas Close sees dead people. Been there done that. There's been movies, TV series and a sea of novels with the same themes and concepts. When Nicholas mentions his 'ability' to others, even close friends, they pull away thinking he's crazy or desperate for attention. Oddly this doesn't seem to happen this way in real life. Start talking about the occult or the paranormal and at least in my circles people come running to share their experiences.<br \/>Fleeing a horrible death, which he sees over and over, Nicholas returns to his childhood home seeking safety and stability (another overdone concept all too common in everything from fantasy to Harlequin Romances). Only to find that nowhere is safe.<br \/>Nicholas' family is just as messed up as he is and brings nothing to the table to care about.

The world also isn't built out as well as it could be.  The people occupying towns and buildings that the main character visits have little to no story attached, or if they do, its not weaved into the plot and instead is a temporary departure from the tale that doesn't add to the development of the main characters.<br \/><br \/>Logan is a talented writer, and he has a good editor so his stories read easily.

What's real, what's not? Does it matter? Or does it only matter what we *think* is real? Ugh.

Honestly, a lot of it feels drawn out and like filler to make a full book, which you run into a lot when authors try to stretch one story into a full series. It really did drag on and on and not to the benefit of building the story.<br \/><br \/>I did like that it was a different concept. Fated goes the Native American route, which hasn't been touched on too very much in recent young adult paranormal books. I'm confident I would have loved the book if I didn't feel it was half filler.<br \/><br \/>Since this is a young adult book, here is my parental blurb: teen sexuality, underage drinking, mentions of drug use, gruesome images, and cursing.

The book was written over a decade ago, and as far as I can tell has not been updated. The herbal information in it is still pertinent. The dating wouldn't be an issue if the book stuck to strictly herbal remedies, as you'd think it would, but it delves into newborn care- which is where the information is useless. (Example: The author says that if you have a son in the United States, he will automatically be circumcised- which is not the case anymore.)<br \/>I was anticipating a little more on the fertility side. However, the fertility portion of the book is miniscule. Most of the fertility chapter is about birth control, permanent sterilization, and abortion- all of which I am morally opposed to, so the book offers me little personally useful information on that end.<br \/>The book is a little hokey.

The Indian boy servant played a very strong role in portraying the hate that the local Indians had for the colonials and you see their side of the story, which I found it all very educational and also how painstaking the process was for the first 'photo'!

NEED TO KNOW: A NOVEL is so well written, it is probably among the best of these.<br \/><br \/>However, the plot is fantastical:  a CIA counterintelligence analyst (Viv) develops software for tracking Russian sleeper-cell networks, and her first success turns up a photograph of her husband (Matt) in a five-person sleeper cell.  Confronted by Viv, Matt freely admits that he’s been working for the Russians for many years.  (This all happens in the first 27 pages; in Chapters 1 and 2).  The remainder of the book is about Viv’s efforts to preserve her family, while still working for the CIA, and remaining loyal to her country.<br \/><br \/>The novel is suspenseful, if you care about Viv, Matt, and their beautiful children.  However, I couldn't connect with them, and I kept thinking as I was reading that this plot idea had already been adequately explored by the FX TV series.","images":[],"asin":"1524797022","parent_asin":"1524797022","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1504910051528,"helpful_vote":12,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1102,"length_group":2}

It's set in a small, segregated town in Texas, sometime after JFK's assassination. I couldn't place the actual time period, and the town and its citizens' attitudes seemed impossibly quaint for a post-1960s setting.  I kept thinking that the novel belonged in turn-of-the-century (1900s) historical detective fiction.<br \/><br \/>The characters are one-dimensional, and I didn't care for the young, newly-appointed, totally inexperienced Police Chief Craddock at all.  The plot hook--the discovery of 5 children's bodies in a burning house in &#34;Darktown&#34;--failed to grab me.  Craddock fans will no doubt enjoy this prequel that describes Craddock's first real case, but it doesn't inspire me to read the other five books in this series.

I did come across a few typos, and the overall flow seemed a bit choppy throughout. Betsy’s character was accidentally referred to as Patsy on numerous occasions, and the final message of the book seemed to be a forewarning to parents to keep a close eye on their kids.

The only reason I'll read the second one is because it's also from the library, but I already know that it'll be your typical female-heroine-becomes-the-reluctant-leader-of-the-rebellion storyline.","images":[],"asin":"037321006X","parent_asin":"037321006X","user_id":"AH7P2ZJ7NDT2NNVS7ZEGNEPT2J2Q","timestamp":1493654130000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":806,"length_group":2}

The romance started on the last page, so go into this knowing the lack of romance and you will not be disappointed. Fairytale is a story of a beautiful family of 3 that by the end of chapter one has been torn apart.

{"rating":3,"title":"Collection of essays for those considering rehabilitation, NOT a how-to or reference text for experienced rehabilitators.","text":"A useful text, but to be clear this is NOT meant to be a comprehensive reference book about wildlife rehabilitation. This publication (its a 3 ring binder with inserts) is better described as a collection of editorials about topics in wildlife, and the actual reference material is minimal, though useful where it does appear. This book isn't meant to be a guide for situations where the rehabber finds him or herself dealing with an emergency or species to which they're not accustomed, or a collection of scientific, veterinary, or taxonomic information (which is what I was hoping for). This is more for &#34;getting your feet wet&#34; and seems to be geared towards someone *considering* entering wildlife rehabilitation than towards the experienced rehabilitator (or animal professional) who needs a text to reference to fill in holes in their experience or to double check their knowledge.<br \/><br \/>Because it's basically a collection of essays, it can be very difficult to locate the information you need-- or to even tell if it's in the book at all-- within the text. A given essay on a topic may or may not touch on the info you're looking for, and typically doesn't go into sufficient depth for practical application.<br \/><br \/>It does offer a lot of good tips for legally  establishing yourself as a rehabilitator and opening a center\/fundraising etc along those lines, but most topics on actual rehabilitation of wildlife are remedial at best. Typically the reader is advised to just take the animal to the vet, to another rehabilitator, or to euthanize it (or rather, have a vet do so). However in the real world those options aren't always available, especially in emergency situations. This text will unfortunately be of little additional help if a rehabilitator needs a quick run-down on how to handle a less-than-ideal situation. Most experienced rehabilitators will find this text of only minimal value, at best.<br \/><br \/>I completely understand why the NWRA doesn't want to enable lay people without the proper experience or supervision to start billing themselves as rehabilitators or to think they're capable or rehabilitation simply because they purchased a book, and that's definitely the perspective from which the text is written. However, as an experienced rehabilitator and a professional in an animal husbandry industry, I feel there's great need for the kind of reference that this text misleadingly bills itself as. As it stands I've gotten very little use out of this purchase and was overall very disappointed with the depth of material.","images":[],"asin":"B0006QNTOC","parent_asin":"B0006QNTOC","user_id":"AGXGWJ3VEAQNTVEIVQH6LMOJWF2Q","timestamp":1507832813792,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2574,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Biography Focuses on Exterminator's Trainer, Owner, Stablemate","text":"As a child, I read and loved [[ASIN:B005CM1M1W Old Bones the Wonder Horse Kentucky Derby Champion]], which is all about the horse Exterminator (and even written from the horse's viewpoint!).  This is why I wanted to read a biography of the famous Kentucky Derby winner that was written for adults.  However, I was disappointed by HERE COMES EXTERMINATOR!, which doesn't really focus on Exterminator, and which glosses over most of the gelding's specific races without giving any detail other than that the horse lost or won.<br \/><br \/>HERE COMES EXTERMINATOR! is actually a recounting of the early history of American thoroughbred racing--before, during, and after World War I.  During the war, there was a lot of political emphasis on developing strong thoroughbred bloodlines for the &#34;remount&#34; program--which involved breeding and supplying horses to the U.S. and other nations'  military  cavalry divisions.  After the war, the emphasis shifted, more to racing for racing's sake, because horses were no longer needed to fight wars, pull trams and milk trucks, etc.<br \/><br \/>The book contains a great deal of biographical information about Exterminator's trainer (Henry McDaniel) and his owner (Willis Sharpe Kilmer).  Kilmer was a man made rich by marketing his family's patent medicine (Swamp Root), and was an extremely difficult person who had more money than he knew what to do with.<br \/><br \/>The horse that is really featured in this book is Exterminator's stablemate, Sun Briar, who was Kilmer's great favorite.  McDaniel acquired Exterminator as a workout horse to challenge Sun Briar, and ended up running Exterminator rather than Sun Briar in the Kentucky Derby.  It was a surprise to everyone when Exterminator won the Derby.  In fact, Sun Briar was another great racehorse (who happened to have a bad year as a 3-year-old).  Modern-day thoroughbreds that trace their lineage back to Sun Briar include Secretariat, Native Dancer, Seattle Slew, Funny Cide, California Chrome, and American Pharoah.<br \/><br \/>This is a well-researched, readable, history of early thoroughbred racing in America, with decent biographies of the people surrounding Exterminator.  However, because I was looking for a book with more about the particular horse, I rate it at 3 stars (&#34;It's okay&#34; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1250065690","parent_asin":"1250065690","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1462320353000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2337,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Not exactly strangers. This was better as short magazine stories for me.","text":"I love the idea of this couple and their story. However, it turns out that I don't actually love the book. The hype was that these two are strangers and they bound off on a whim & a prayer for three weeks, but that's not exactly right. Turns out they had known one another and dated for several weeks prior to this fanciful excursion. Granted, that isn't a long time, but still they had a very intimate relationship and connection before they got on the flight to Turkey.

{"rating":3,"title":"Recipe I made was deeply flavorful; prep time is for Iron Chefs; book has confusing info & mistakes","text":"Cookbooks that are dedicated to help relieve the symptoms of a disease are generally ones that are full of healthy recipes. This one is no exception. I love healthy and wholesome whole foods and have been eating that way most of my adult life. Although I do not have rheumatoid arthritis, I do suffer from inflammation and wanted a guide that has a meal plan along those lines.<br \/><br \/>I read this from front to back and, although there are over 20 recipes in this book I would make, some information given at the beginning of the book is contradictory. For instance, page 16 states that the recipes feature whole foods, yet anti-inflammatory smoothies are on the menu. Even though a smoothie features whole foods, those foods are more glycemic since they are basically pulverized. On page 55 she mentions the flare-soothing meal plan will not include ingredients like honey. However, honey is included on page 57 on the flare-soothing plan shopping list. For the \"Basil Pesto Pizza with Mushroms and Spinach\" recipe on page 111, the spinach ingredient in the name of the recipe is not listed in the ingredient list--instead the recipe calls for chopped artichokes. I am unsure if spinach should be included with that or in place of that.  Also, page 12 ends with the word \"These\" as the start of a sentence where the rest of the sentence or paragraph is nowhere to be found. There is only one sentence for the entire section and after reading that sentence, I felt like I was missing something when it ended on that one word.<br \/><br \/>Despite the above, the recipes read like they would be fantastic--flavorful and healthy. I decided to make the \"Italian Sausage and Kale Soup\" and the depth of flavor was out of this world. I attached a sequence of before and after photos. However, the prep time must be for an Iron Chef because it said it would take me only 15 minutes to prep and it took me about two hours. I admit I am slower than most because I like to lay all my ingredients out, but it definitely was not a 15-minute prep for anyone but the most advanced and speediest cook.<br \/><br \/>In summary, there are just so many recipes I would make in this book. Even if one does not have arthritis, this is a great addition to any cookbook library despite my three-star rating. I was going to rate this book four stars but the reason I lowered it to three is because of the contradictory information in the front. For someone who has rheumatoid arthritis, it is important that the information presented in such a book be clear and not contradictory or confusing. Also,there are only about three recipe pictures in the book and the few other pictures are just of ingredients like garlic or lemon. If a cookbook is going to include pictures, it is important to include a picture of the finished recipe. I would have liked to see more photos. Nevertheless, the recipes themselves appear to be great (excluding the one with the editing error). I know the resulting end product in the recipe I made was out of this world in a flavorful, scrumptious, wholesome, and supremely satisfying sort of way.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/715EL-1SgXL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/715EL-1SgXL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/715EL-1SgXL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Wx8t3mN8L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Wx8t3mN8L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Wx8t3mN8L.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71dLO6vHOeL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71dLO6vHOeL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71dLO6vHOeL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81AR0otYQfL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81AR0otYQfL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81AR0otYQfL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1641528664","parent_asin":"1641528664","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1589652766018,"helpful_vote":10,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3102,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Disjointed and many unanswered questions. Author should have kept a journal to write the book with","text":"I wanted to love this book - I love the idea behind it. A woman striking out to explore some of the most fascinating areas of the world, on her own, on foot and without the typical tourist luxuries. Almost immediately, I realized that I don't like Sarah Marquis much - as a writer, as a person or as another woman. That's a shame because this book is all about her and it is her story, so finding her bothersome tainted every word. As a woman who has traveled some difficult locales alone, I fully respect and understand the urge to go and see and experience the planet. My problem with Ms Marquis is her hubris and her selfishness while she followed this same urge. Ms Marquis repeatedly seems disdainful of the local people she has contact with throughout her journey in Mongolia and China.<br \/><br \/>The book is written in a manner that feels more like a jumble of memories tossed together with a stream of consciousness instead of from notes or journals kept during the adventure. Events happen and are never resolved, questions are never answered - why did Mongolian men urinate on or near her repeatedly? Did she ever actually see wolves, or just dream about it? Why did she schedule this adventure knowing her beloved dog was elderly and likely wouldn't live until her return? Why not wait? Why didn't she bother to educate herself about basic culture and customs before traipsing through China? She states that she was glad she didn't fill her mind with this extra information, but that struck me as arrogant and dangerous. Maybe if she had, she could have avoided putting herself in multiple dangerous positions. Many of the problems she had throughout the book were self inflicted. I don't hate this book, but I don't like it enough to recommend it to my friends - all of whom would ask the same questions.","images":[],"asin":"1250081971","parent_asin":"1250081971","user_id":"AHPOHKN4PU4W3V5PGFL7AGTAD2AA","timestamp":1447867844000,"helpful_vote":35,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1817,"length_group":3}

The pages of the book feature cute, colorful, cartoon- style images and a basic story fit for the younger- age crowd, preschool to perhaps kindergarten.<br \/><br \/>Mouse’s Christmas Cookie is a very simple book with almost no dialogue, which makes it an okay choice of reading material for the target age group.

{"rating":3,"title":"It somewhat recovers from a bad start and horrible main character","text":"This book is a \"Harem fantasy\", worse its written by someone who is entirely too enamored with a couple of specific Manga series and that resulted in an editorial decision I found extremely annoying.  But the last third ended up being filled with enough action that I'm willing (grudgingly) to give this a very low 3 star rating.<br \/><br \/>Honestly, part of me wishes I could force every man who is going to write a harem fantasy to read what I have to say past this point, there were a number of huge issues with this book, and they came down to sloppy thinking on the part of the author.<br \/><br \/>First, Scott here (for some reason I originally put Tristan, but he's the MC in a different but frighteningly similarly bad harem book.), as is entirely too common with harem fantasy tales is a barely functioning moron.  He is dumb.  I almost used a line I've actually used in some other recent reviews of wanting to channel Kuni from the movie UHF.  \"Stupid!  You're so STUPID!\".  Seriously, I get that a huge part of harem fantasy is that the main character must think about girls, girls, girls and occasionally even..... girls!  But there is a point where there must be some thought about, I don't know, survival?  Food?  What is safe to be doing at that moment?  Tristan just stumbles from set piece to set piece thinking with his \"meat and two veg\" and that really makes him a flat character.  He doesn't actually engage with the story much early as he's a passenger in it.<br \/><br \/>Second, this was more unique to Edward, but there is a \"fourth wall\" in entertainment for a reason, and breaking that is just stupid.  Edward has Scott almost thinking to the reader, and its often about Scott's obsession with a manga series about.... Monster Girls.  (go figure.).  I get that Tristan is supposed to be a barely functioning virginal moron who's only thought is to put his tab A into any monster girl's slot B.  heck, even after he's repeatedly warned that the hybrid women of the world he finds himself on don't like being called \"Monster Girls\", he uses it repeatedly.<br \/><br \/>Third, in the beginning there was a bit of a continuity flow problem.  The attempt to set up a bit of backstory and the heroic death of Scott so that his rebirth in the Monster Girl world made sense jumped around the timeline a bit.  He mentions that he started going to the comic book shop at age 11, got a job there at 15, but before that mentions being 20.  The flow was choppy, and while I honestly didn't care about the MCs age (mentally he's too immature for it to matter.).  I do prefer that stories work with a logical timeline, and this didn't really have one for that section, or at least it wasn't presented in a logical way.<br \/><br \/>Fourth, kill the sidekick.  In this case is an invisible, intelligent piece of parchment that only the MC can see and read.  It did serve the purpose of being the \"author ex machina\" character that drove the plot by dropping in all the information required to force the MC to panic constantly while always withholding information that the MC should have tried to obtain before jumping off the cliff without a parachute.  But it also was just annoying.  The sidekick characters in harem fantasy tales tend to be dumb, boring and capable of sucking all the life out of a tale, and Parch does that constantly.  Once again, its a product of the extremely low intelligence of the characters.  They have no sense, common or otherwise.  Its not fun for me to read.<br \/><br \/>Edward did remove the sex from the story ending many chapters with \"and a good time was had by all\", but offering free access to fully written out sex scenes via the web.  I don't read these books for the sex, so that actually was a plus in my book.  The problem is that the story did not have a lot of character, and the main character was just well below the very low average that can be found in most books in this genre.<br \/><br \/>Some might enjoy this, but I honestly feel it lacked on many levels.  It's just not fun until late and even then it honestly didn't impress me much.  I've read so much better.","images":[],"asin":"B08QFKT8WS","parent_asin":"B08QFKT8WS","user_id":"AE747CPTU3RCQNGPY4OYSSKJHKQQ","timestamp":1610975032448,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":true,"length":4117,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Boring Police Procedural Is Deservedly Optioned for TV Series","text":"TIN BADGES: A NOVEL has been optioned for TV by the producer of “NYPD Blue”, and it should make a terrific TV series.  In the novel, a retired detective (“Tank” Rizzo), his disabled former partner (Pearl), an off-duty NYPD Chief of Detectives (Ray Connors), Tank’s computer-whiz teenage nephew (Chris), and a squad of street-smart misfits make up a team that solves NYPD cold cases (cases handed off to freelancer Tank by Connors).  What a TV series framework!<br \/><br \/>As a novel, though, TIN BADGES is boring and predictable.  Tank gets a not-so-cold case involving the brutal rapes of two women (prostitutes, maybe?) that the NYPD doesn’t want to handle.  It’s likely that the women are connected to an NYC crime boss (Gonzo), who exacts swift and terminal retribution against anyone who knows too much about his operations.<br \/><br \/>When Tank gets onto Gonzo’s radar, it endangers not only his team, but his girlfriend (Connie Tramonti) and her father (Carmine).  Connie and Carmine are the co-owners of Tramonti’s Italian restaurant\/bar\/jazz club, which Carmine established when he retired from running a major organized-crime numbers operation.  The restaurant is now neutral ground for cops and criminals alike.<br \/><br \/>The 14-year-old nephew Chris has just lost his parents in an automobile “accident”, and is living with Tank only because it’s better than entering the foster care system.  Chris hates Tank because Tank and his father had become estranged, and had stopped speaking to each other.  Tank keeps the reason secret until the very end of the book, and the reveal isn’t worth the wait.  Happily, the secret doesn’t affect the plot of this novel in any significant way.<br \/><br \/>The novel’s title is based on the fact (?) that retired gold-shield detectives who freelance like Tank are known as “tin badges”.  The novel is decently written.  The characters are mildly interesting in their cliched fashion (e.g., tough-talking Tank, Bruno the former boxer with a heart of gold, Chris the teenager with mad computer skillz, Connie the sensible and understanding love interest, etc.).  The plot is a perfectly ordinary police procedural plot. More books in the series are promised, but I think that I’ll pass on them, even though I’m looking forward to the TV series.","images":[],"asin":"0345483928","parent_asin":"0345483928","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1568401903485,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2291,"length_group":3}

{"rating":3,"title":"Good Content, but Shallow","text":"I'm not usually of books like this. This one, while not great, was not as horrible as I anticipated. There were a lot of good points made. Many things that I think many Christians today do need to hear. However, it was still shallow and seemed to linger on long after the point was proven. The small group questions were completely useless. They were really not good small group questions, in my opinion. If I were doing this book with a small group, those questions would keep the conversation moving for about 10 minutes, then we'd be done. This book would be a good devotional or small group book for established, but still shallow Christians.<br \/><br \/>The forward by Bill Hybels was actually a turn off for me. It didn't say much of anything about the content of the book. It read like a job reference, not like an actual forward that contributes to the book. It was very clear that a bigger name was wanted for the book, so Hybels wrote a quick note about the author so they could put his name on the cover and add credit to the otherwise little known authors.<br \/><br \/>I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze Blogger program.

{"rating":3,"title":"Good Design Tips Plus Three Very Good Patterns Equals 3.5 Stars","text":"The excellent description of the design process that accompanies each pattern in this book justifies the purchase price.  Designer Ohrenstein explains why she chose particular stitches, what yarn characteristics needed her special attention, and what issues she faced in constructing each garment.  For example, in the notes to her attractive hooded vest, she remarks:  \"By studying the hoods on two garments I own, I learned one thing that's odd about hoods:  they can attach to a point below the neck, but must sit on the head at an angle.\"<br \/><br \/>The book includes patterns using (1) shell and fan stitches (capelets, bracelet, shrug, sweaters, bikini, long vest, jacket); (2) diamond and wheel stitches (ruana, scarf, hat, purse); and ripple and wave stitches (hooded vest, belt, mini-dress, skirt, beach coverup, tote bag).  Three of the patterns are particularly noteworthy.  The bikini pattern is one of the best that I've seen--very attractive as a garment, beautifully fitted, and probably functional as a swimsuit that can go in and out of the water.  The hooded vest with crosswise waves and an ample hood is probably my favorite pattern from the book--something that I'd like to make.  The resort mini-dress is a pretty, eye-catching tube of feather and fan stitch that is gathered with a cord at the neckline to provide \"shaping\"--more of a beach coverup than a dress, but it's simple and attractive, and might also work as a skirt.<br \/><br \/>However, many of the other patterns use overlarge stitches that are out of scale on the human body (for example, the \"Big Fans\" vest).  Garments like this will crochet up quickly, but they aren't really \"fashionable\".  Also, many of the garments use rather garish color schemes (for example, the \"Toreador Jacket\" with dark red body, and sleeves and bottom edging of light purple and light green stripes).  These color schemes cheapen the look of the garments.  And finally, some of the garments don't really drape (for example, the \"A Rose Is a Rose Jacket\", which has unshaped tube sleeves, and in my opinion, makes the model look fat).<br \/><br \/>In sum, this is a very good crochet design book, but only a so-so pattern book.  That's why it's not quite worth 4 stars.","images":[],"asin":"1601407904","parent_asin":"1601407904","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1268676401000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2232,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Anecdotal Introduction to Mushroom-Hunting in New England States","text":"CHANTERELLE DREAMS, which focuses on mushrooms commonly found in the New England states, is neither a general introduction to mycology for beginners nor a mushroom-hunter's field guide.  Most of the text consists of anecdotes about the author's personal enjoyment of, and experiences with, wild mushrooms;  about well-publicized cases of mushroom poisoning; about religious and cultural uses of mushrooms; and about myths and lore surrounding glow-in-the-dark mushrooms, fairy rings, and the like.<br \/><br \/>Clearly the author is an expert in things mycological, but his technical descriptions of specific mushrooms can be difficult for beginners to follow.  For example (p. 38):  \"Morels are saprobes, using as their food source leaf duff and wood in the soil.  They have also been shown to form symbiotic, mycorrhizal associations with various tree species during parts of their life cycle.  Their mycelia colonize broad areas, and often the fruiting body appears far from the original site of inoculation or obvious food source.\"  Such information--undoubtedly of interest to experienced mushroom collectors--seems out of place in a book that isn't intended as a field guide.  However, happily for the mycological novice, most of the stories that comprise the bulk of the text are far, far easier to read.<br \/><br \/>One fact that particularly caught my attention, is that some mushrooms (e.g., morels) can be mildly poisonous if not cooked before ingestion.  CHANTERELLE DREAMS includes various mushroom recipes, a lot of good advice on how to get started with collecting mushrooms (e.g., start by joining a local mushroom club), instructions for growing your own mushrooms, a bibliography of recommended and supplemental reading, and an eight-page section of beautiful full-color photographs of selected mushrooms. Experienced mushroom collectors--especially those located in the New England states--will probably enjoy reading this book.  However, the book is probably not the best choice for a mycological novice who has only a casual interest in learning about mushrooms or in actually gathering mushrooms.","images":[],"asin":"1603582142","parent_asin":"1603582142","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1295304785000,"helpful_vote":20,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2115,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Ambivalent feeling toward this one","text":"The premise of \"Afterwards\" by Rosamund Lupton is similar to that of \"The Lovely Bones\":  a dead  (or nearly dead) person communicates with others in an attempt to uncover a crime.  In the case of \"Afterwards,\" the crime is arson, and the beginning of the book is well done--fast-paced, interesting, and  engaging.  The main character rushes into a burning school to save her teenaged daughter.  Both mother and daughter are severely injured in the fire, and their spirits communicate with one another as they  lie in comas in the local hospital.  Then minor characters (father, son) become involved as Mom tries to discover who set the fire and why.<br \/><br \/>After this superb beginning, this novel simply bogs down.  It is too long in the middle, and there is far too much psychological analysis for my taste. Of course the reader wants to know underlying complexity of motivation, but too much is too much.  Mother and daughter communicate, and parts of this section are confusing.  It is occasionally difficult to know who is speaking.  Mom finds out things she never knew about her family--surprise, surprise--and the incredible and undying love of a mother for her child is repeatedly reinforced.<br \/><br \/>In the end, the reader discovers who set the fire, and the answer is very unexpected. There are any number of likely suspects, and the motivations of each are explored, but most readers will not guess the identity of the arsonist.<br \/><br \/>To sum up, this was a good story, but not great.  I notice that many other reviewers have mentioned Lupton's other book, \"Sister.\"  I plan to read this book to see if I can get a better handle on her storytelling.  For now, count me in the ambivalent category.","images":[],"asin":"0307716546","parent_asin":"0307716546","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1339776973000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1718,"length_group":3}

This whole book had a cartoonish feel to it, from the characters to the settings to the plot.  It is fairly well written, i.e., flows well, grammatical, characters do things that are inherently consistent to the author's descriptions of them, etc. That's the only reason I could finish this, But it is just... not a book I could get into emotionally.  Not one character is likable.  Some live by super moral codes.  But they are all shallowly drawn with little to like or hate because of their superficiality.  The plot, a missing person search for a partner in a business that makes going to jail easier for convicts with money, dragged and the developments were ho hum.  Not one thing was scary.  Not one thing was thrilling.  I just did not care.

{"rating":3,"title":"Teaching Kids....Slang?","text":"Chicken Cheeks is an unusual children's book that focuses its attention on teaching children different slang terms for buttocks, with different animals and different terms for each. This book is unlike most other children's books and while certainly silly, its subject matter makes it the type of book that some parents and children will find amusing while others will find it useless and possibly even offensive.<br \/><br \/>Children's books are usually educational to some degree and they can be counted on to teach facts or implant an important lesson into the brains of young learners everywhere. Chicken Cheeks does offer a small amount of educational value, but not much. It wants children to learn about different animals and how they look, but it also wants kids to learn some new and unusual ways to refer to the hind quarters of different earthly creatures. The animals often have confused, even disgusted looks as they are left with their faces in the derrieres of other animals and this could be met with laughs and giggles from youngsters. But other than becoming familiar with different animals, the educational nature of this book ends right there.<br \/><br \/>Among the different qualities of Chicken Cheeks, the one that stands out is the illustrations. This book offers some good and often silly illustrations of animals and most have a surprised expression on their faces. Others have a look of strain, like the poor little guinea pig that must balance a deer in its hands. Aside from the animals, there isn't much else going on with each page because the animals continue to stack themselves on top of one another. And that means the remaining parts of each page feature mostly blue sky and a few clouds. But the illustrations of the animals are fun, and sometimes clever.<br \/><br \/>Chicken Cheeks is short on dialogue and short on story. Each page contains either two words or a few more, if that is what it takes to come up with a new slang term to describe an animal's rear end. There isn't much else to the story, even though it does end on a semi- humorous note when a swarm of bees causes the animal pyramid to collapse with \"The Ends\" written in large black letters as each animal dives into the sky and water below, with only their rear- ends still in view.<br \/><br \/>Chicken Cheeks is a difficult book to rate. The story line is practically non- existent, the educational value is lacking, and the book emphasizes the learning of slang terms. But it's a very silly book that, depending on the children it is read to, could result in a good deal of laughter and giggles as parents read the different slang words to refer to animal's buttocks. It's one of those few books that will affect everyone who reads it in a different way, resulting in ratings that could be anywhere from one to five stars. I find it pretty lacking, but it does offer originality and my little girls did like the goofy pictures. So, I'm going to give this book a recommendation by the slimmest of margins. It isn't a great book by a long shot, but it has enough good qualities to make it worth a look.","images":[],"asin":"1416948643","parent_asin":"1416948643","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1232832360000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3103,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Competent Mystery Inspired by True Crimes of Cleveland's \"Mad Butcher\"","text":"A competent but somewhat slow-moving mystery, inspired by the unsolved crimes of Cleveland's notorious \"Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run\" (active 1934-1950).  The novel is something of a tour-de-force, because it \"solves\" the cold Mad Butcher case through flashbacks, even as the heroine  solves present-day murders committed by a copycat killer who is methodically recreating the Butcher's gruesome crime scenes.<br \/><br \/>I particularly enjoyed the flashback mystery, which tells the story of fictional detective James Miller, who is probably the only honest cop in the corrupt depression-era Cleveland police force. James figures out the Mad Butcher's identity, but ends up as one of the Butcher's victims. It is the present-day discovery of James' decapitated body (with head tucked between the legs) in a walled-up portion of a building that is being demolished, that triggers the murderous rampage of the present-day killer.<br \/><br \/>James is a likeable and believable character, and one is saddened by the knowledge of his ultimate fate as one reads the well-plotted account of his ill-fated 1935-1936 investigation.  The author's theory about the possible identity of the real Mad Butcher is a very good one, except that, as she admits in her back-of-the-book acknowledgments, that theory is exploded by certain facts about historical train routes.  No matter, as this is not a true crime book.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, the heroine--forensic scientist Theresa MacLean--is yet another post-Patricia-Cornwell female investigator who always runs directly into danger, even as her own common sense screams \"foolhardy!\"  For example, when Theresa is alone at night on a deserted hillside in a bad Cleveland neighborhood, and stumbles on a perp who happens to be burying parts of a body, she runs after the fleeing perp.  Her explanation:  \"I was thinking I would like to get a look at the guy who was burying two dead bodies.\"<br \/><br \/>Despite Theresa's occupation, there are relatively few forensic details, and forensics do not ultimately solve the present-day murders.  There are various loose ends that aren't particularly well handled at the end of the book, although these generally involve red-herring clues that were only included to misdirect readers, and don't really detract from the story.  The greatest weakness of the book is the unbelievable, over-the-top ending, which neatly disposes of the killer, but calls for both Theresa and the killer to demonstrate extraordinary physical strength and stamina.<br \/><br \/>This is an entertaining mystery.  I was never tempted to jump forward to the end to find out whether it was worth finishing the book.  However, I  rate it 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 stars because of the incredible closing scenes.  The author is a skilled writer, and could have written a much better ending without changing anything that preceded it.","images":[],"asin":"0061989339","parent_asin":"0061989339","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1294431919000,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2886,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Cozy Mystery Is Spoiled by Forced “Alice in Wonderland” References","text":"The “Alice in Wonderland” references in A MOST CURIOUS MURDER: A LITTLE LIBRARY MYSTERY are so forced, they eventually spoil what might otherwise be a reasonably good cozy mystery.<br \/><br \/>A major character, Zoe Zola, is a highly intelligent “little person” who is writing a nonfiction book about Lewis Carroll’s famous work.  Zoe generally talks in riddles sprinkled with quotes from “Alice”.  She also loves fairies and has a gorgeous flower garden ornamented with “fairy houses”.  Yes, she’s an eccentric character—the sort of character you generally expect, and appreciate, in a cozy mystery.  However, Zoe’s disjointed speech patterns don’t make her loveable—they’re just confusing, and they slow down the story. Worse, Zoe’s “Alice” references are dropped in so frequently, and with so little connection to anything in the plot, they ultimately come off as a mere book sales gimmick.<br \/><br \/>The other major character, Jenny Weston, is reeling from a recent divorce, and has returned to her mother’s place in Bear Falls, Michigan.  Jenny is all wrapped up in how she’s been dumped by two men--her former husband and her high school sweetheart.  The former sweetheart is married, still living in Bear Falls, and obviously a train wreck that Jenny was lucky to avoid.  Still, Jenny spends much of her time brooding about her romantic misfortunes and her lingering feelings for the sweetheart.  Otherwise, she renews a lot of her old acquaintances with long-time Bear Falls residents.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, there are two mysteries to be solved: “Who murdered the spiteful old curmudgeon found dead in Zoe’s fairy garden?” and “Who hacked apart the ‘Little Library’ book exchange box that stood for years in the front yard of Jenny’s childhood home?”  Rather inexplicably, the local police chief focuses on Zoe as the major suspect in the curmudgeon’s murder.  No one has any idea who murdered the book box.  Both mysteries are eventually solved.<br \/><br \/>The murder mystery plot was fairly interesting until the ending.  But the ending is marred because all of the plot threads are wrapped up too quickly in the final few chapters.  There isn’t enough preparation for the “reveal” of the murderer; the book-box-destroyer’s motivation is extremely weak; and the incredible, timely return to Bear Falls of a long-missing resident conveniently solves a mystery from Jenny’s past that didn’t even need to be solved.<br \/><br \/>Because of the gimmicky &quot;Alice&quot; aspects, and the disappointing ending, I rate A MOST CURIOUS MURDER at 3 stars (&quot;It's okay&quot; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1629536067","parent_asin":"1629536067","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1469311260000,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2611,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Primarily Valuable for Politically-Charged Images","text":"THE FEMINIST REVOLUTION: THE STRUGGLE FOR WOMEN’S LIBERATION is a contemporary history of feminism, commencing with the year 1966, the year that the National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded.  To the extent that it’s a serious history, it merely describes what feminists and anti-feminists were doing and saying in the years from 1966 through the 1980s.  The text portions are based for the most part on newspaper, magazine, and journal articles.<br \/><br \/>To my mind, this volume is a picture book, primarily valuable for the scanned, politically-charged images of protesters, advertisements for feminist events, political cartoons, newspaper stories, magazine covers, and the like.  Indeed, the images overpower the accompanying text, which is set in small type and often displayed on colored backgrounds (as if no one is really expected to actually read it).  The oversized, square book format also detracts from the readability of the text.<br \/><br \/>The subtitles of the chapters are generally a better guide to the topics than the actual, politicized titles (e.g., ch. 1 “‘Sisterhood is powerful’”, subtitled “How the movement mobilized”).  The subtitles are as follows:  (1) How the movement mobilized; (2) The struggle for liberation; (3) Civil rights and liberation; (4) Reclaiming the physical and mental treatment of women; (5) Sexuality and lesbian feminism; (6) Reinventing culture in and out of the workplace; (7) Publishing and the media; (8) Music and the arts; (9) The anti-war and anti-nuclear debate; and (10) Radicalization, fragmentation, and educating the next generation.<br \/><br \/>The history is very fragmented--for example, Ms. Magazine, which caused many 1970s women to wake up and become feminists (remember the “clicks”?) doesn’t appear until ch. 7 (page 154 out of 220-plus pages).  Also, the choice of mostly politically-charged images makes the whole book seem biased and “shrill”, even though the text itself is written with a balanced, neutral tone.","images":[],"asin":"1588346129","parent_asin":"1588346129","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1533064680541,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1994,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Presidential Dishonesty","text":"Author David Corn is a journalist, with contributions to the Nation, Fox News, and several influential newspapers. He has followed the actions of many important leaders during his time in the media. In this book, he presents and elaborates on some of the numerous lies told by President George W. Bush.<br \/>Corn begins this book by explaining to the reader that all U.S. presidents have done their fair share of lying and he provides examples for a few of them, making sure to cover both Republicans and Democrats so that the reader can see that he is not strictly anti- GOP.  Then, he gets into the heart of the book by first presenting Bush's lies when he was governor, followed by Bush's countless lies he had told when he was a candidate for president, all the way through his first few years as president.<br \/>Corn devotes separate chapters to different areas of lying. There is a chapter or two on the Bush tax plan, one on his position on stem cell research, one on the Enron scandal, and a few others. But the topic that receives the most coverage in this book is that of the military and, more specifically, the war against Iraq. Corn shows the endless barrage of lies that came from the Bush White House during this time, starting with the fibs about the reasons to go to war (like the weapons of mass destruction claim), then leading to the grossly understated cost of the war and the dishonesty about the casualties and the peace process to rebuild the nation of Iraq.<br \/>In each chapter, Corn highlights some of the key lies in boldface text, and he places them before the paragraph that the quote appears. There are more lies in this book than just those told by George W. Bush himself. The lies include those told by other members of the Bush administration, like Powell, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and others.<br \/>Corn does an effective job in his uncovering of these many untruths and with his explanations about each lie. He presents the quote, then he backs up his claim that the quote was false by presenting other quotes and facts that directly contradict what the president or one of his team said. He manages to be respectful throughout the book (as respectful as an author can be, given the subject) and he points out that Bush has told the truth sometimes, too. But the main idea of this book is that Bush is as good of a liar as anyone who has ever held the White House and he will tell any lie necessary if it means getting what he wants.<br \/>If there is any complaint that I have about this book, it would have to be the fact that most of what it talks about is now old news. Most people already know about the deceptions and falsehoods surrounding the war against Iraq, the Bush tax plan, and other topics. Thus, for those readers who try to stay in tune with the latest political happenings, there won't be very much new to read in this book. Also, in some instances, Corn really seems to be splitting hairs. With a few of the quotes, he tries to make them out to be something far more radical than their speaker intended them to be.<br \/>I like the way Corn ends the book by presenting some possible explanations on why presidents and other politicians tell so many lies and why the media has been so soft on George W. Bush. Corn feels that journalists need to come down harder on the president and force him to admit the truth. This final chapter is good for those who want a little more insight on why lying is so commonplace and why no one does much about it, although it doesn't go very in- depth in finding an answer.<br \/>Politicians have always told lies. Nothing is going to change this fact in the foreseeable future. George W. Bush has told more than his share of presidential falsehoods and David Corn exposes many of them in this book, with analysis of each lie, along with facts and quotes to back up his assertion that George W. Bush is one of the greatest liars to ever occupy the oval office. The book isn't perfect, but Corn does present a good resource for the politically misinformed, showing how one man and his administrative team can effectively deceive and mislead the people and change the course of history in the process.","images":[],"asin":"1400050669","parent_asin":"1400050669","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1078926810000,"helpful_vote":55,"verified_purchase":true,"length":4175,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Why Relativism and Constructivism are Wrong","text":"Is there such a thing as objective facts? Most would say yes, but there are those who take a different view and who think what we perceive as facts and how we construct knowledge has everything to do with culture and other conditions. There is no doubt that our culture influences what we think and believe, but does it mean that plain, evident, in- your- face truth is still relevant to the individual and his\/her circumstances? A book that is ready to challenge this notion is Fear of Knowledge.<br \/><br \/>Short in length, this philosophical guide presents some of the common arguments in favor of relativism and constructivism and shows why they are not true. For someone like me, who is already against these two schools of thought, this book was a classic example of preaching to the choir. However, I did like some of the refutations it offers, and it did provide me some ammunition to use whenever someone tries to spout off in favor of these constructs.<br \/><br \/>This philosophical book will make the most sense to students of philosophy and others who already have a basic understanding of relativism and constructivism. If you do not, it might be good to consult a reputable online source and gain an understanding before you start to read. In fact, the book could have been improved by explaining and defining relativism and constructivism better than it does. I did like some of the examples it suggests, to help readers put things into perspective. But given the increased use of relativism and constructivism over the past few years, I can think of many better, real- world examples it could have used. In addition to explaining these concepts better, I also felt the book would have been improved if it spent more time showing why objectivism is correct. It instead devotes most of its space to explaining why the other side is wrong.<br \/><br \/>With the writing, Fear of Knowledge is good and generally free from errors, but it isn’t a book for light, easy reading. I found myself re- reading the text more than once, just to make sure I had a full grasp of what they author was trying to convey. It can get a little rough at times, but the same can be said of many philosophical books. Just be patient as you read and you shouldn’t have any trouble picking up on what the book is trying to say.<br \/><br \/>Relativism and constructivism are all around us. These concepts do not have much to support them philosophically, but there are diehards who still think we live in a relativistic world and that no objective truth exists. Fear of Knowledge is out to change all of that. It may not succeed at converting the full- fledged relativists among us, but it does make for some good, intellectual reading for those who want to better understand this area of philosophy and who need some tools to use to strike down those who follow it.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51wl+OxI6vL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51wl+OxI6vL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51wl+OxI6vL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"0199230412","parent_asin":"0199230412","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1667523373921,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2851,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Better Hide Your Cake: Clarence is on the Prowl","text":"The Cake Thief is a good children's book written for children in the one to five age group. It tells the story of Clarence, an unusual boy who has a habit of stealing cakes. He steals any type of cake and for any reason, completely oblivious to fact that his actions are unethical.<br \/><br \/>This book offers a storyline that is simple and direct and most children in the one to five- year old age group will find it to their liking. There are slightly more words on some pages than others, but the words are kept under control, making this story a relatively quick read. As far as the dialogue, it is generally good, but I did have a few problems with the choice of words in some instances. Inclusion of words like \"fretted\" and \"peculiar\" might be too much for children in the targeted age group. I doubt most young toddlers are going to understand words like these, leading to a little bit of confusion, depending on the child.<br \/><br \/>Storylines and dialogue are one thing, but what matters even more to young children in a book are the illustrations. And The Cake Thief has plenty of good illustrations. The colors are vibrant and include representations across the spectrum. I also like the way some of the characters are drawn. Clarence is drawn with a stocking cap on his head and a blinder across his face; allowing space for his eyes and making him look the part of a thief. Also, I like the way Clarence transforms his look once he quits stealing cakes. Look closely and you will see that Clarence loses the blinder once he has baked his cake and is heading for a party. He no longer has anything to hide, and he lets himself be seen. This loss of accompaniments isn't mentioned in the story. Only someone who is paying close attention to the illustrations will realize that Clarence is now a new person; someone who has given up the life of a thief because he now realizes that he can make his own cakes and therefore doesn't need to steal them anymore.<br \/><br \/>Overall, The Cake Thief is a pretty good children's book that most kids will find attention- getting for its illustrations. It could use a few small improvements in the overall storyline, and a little bit of rhythm and\/or rhyme would be nice. But the book itself is still good overall, with a direct story that starts and ends in a short time, making it a good choice for an afternoon read or a nightcap before bedtime.","images":[],"asin":"1419683926","parent_asin":"1419683926","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1206472112000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2400,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"An old friend that has aged gracefully","text":"Although this book is showing its age it remains one of the very few available books on data center operations.  The foundation is three timeless concepts:  (1) data is a resource, (2) data processing (or in more contemporary terms, systems management) is a service function, and (3) data processing is a production business.<br \/>Despite the slant towards &quot;Big Blue&quot; platforms and operating systems and the non-automated processes provided in this book, there are still valuable practices that can be gleaned, given a modern facelift and incorporated into client\/server and e-commerce operations.  For example, Section Two contains a wealth of information on achieving stable production processes that are as applicable in a modern data center as they were when this book was written.  The best piece in this section is on component failure analysis, which is one of the most cogent approaches to building a high-availability foundation that I've come across.  I also like the emphasis on problem and change management.  Although the processes are manual, they are well thought out and are a good model for a most up-to-date and automated solution.<br \/>The section on production controls is on the mark from the standpoint of process, but out of date with respect to examples.  However, you can glean a lot of information and ideas from the basics and build upon them using today's technology.  The fundamentals and concepts are sound.<br \/>Overall, this book is something of a paradox - on the one hand it is nearly quaint, and on the other it contains practices that I fear are being quickly lost, yet still sorely needed in order to effectively manage operations in a large enterprise.  I bought my copy when it first came out in 1989 and still refer to it from time to time.  Considering how many obsolete books that I've donated to local libraries while steadfastly refusing to give this one up. I'm strongly recommending it despite its age, but am giving it 3 stars because of its age.","images":[],"asin":"0471283878","parent_asin":"0471283878","user_id":"AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ","timestamp":994195039000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2003,"length_group":3}

Essentially the two books are just one really long novel cut in half, missing the first one will leave you lost from page one of The Hunted. The Hunted moves as quickly as The Living did and that's a good thing because it's got a lot of ground to cover.<br \/><br \/>This is an excellent plot and storyline. There's a bit of a young love angle, a rediscovered family connection when all seems lost, hardship and determination, bad guys, good guys and plenty of action. It's very refreshing to find young adult Latino characters in any book, especially a strong young woman like Carmen. I wanted to love this book. I really liked The Living and gave it four stars. But....The Hunted fell short. It felt very predictable and the main characters repeatedly made stupid choices that should have gotten them killed in the first couple of chapters. This happens time after time (I would list examples, but that would involve spoilers). The dialogue that felt real in the first book seemed to deteriorate and become repetitive in places and lost it's freshness.

While working on a human trafficking case, Salgado's violent temper got the best of him and he beat a suspect within an inch of his life. Ordered on probation, he fled to Argentina to cool off for a few months. Now he's back in Barcelona and is eager for another big case. But his boss has other plans. He assigns Salgado to a routine accidental death: a college student fell from a balcony in one of Barcelona's ritzier neighborhoods. As Salgado begins to piece together the life and world of the victim, he realizes that his death was not all that simple: his teenage friends are either overly paranoid or deceptively calm, and drugs might be involved. Hector begins to follow a trail that will lead him deep into the underbelly of Barcelona's high society where he'll come face-to-face with dangerous criminals, long-buried secrets, and, of course, his own past. But Hector thrives on pressure, and he lives for this kind of case--dark, violent, and seemingly unsolvable.

The killer has left behind a clue connecting the two cases to First Date, a popular online dating service, and Flann McIlroy, an eccentric, publicity-seeking homicide detective, is convinced that only Ellie can help him pursue his terrifying theory: someone is using the lure of the Internet and the promise of love to launch a killing spree against the women of New York City. To catch the killer, Ellie must enter a high-tech world of stolen identities where no one is who they appear to be. And for her, the investigation quickly becomes personal: she fits the profile of the victims, and she knows firsthand what pursuing a sociopath can do to a cop--back home in Wichita, Kansas, her father lost his life trying to catch a notorious serial murderer. When the First Date killer begins to mimic the monster who destroyed her father, Ellie knows the game has become personal for him, too. Both hunter and prey, she must find the killer before he claims his next victim--who could very well be her. Expertly plotted and perfectly paced, Dead Connection advances Alafair Burke to the front ranks of American thriller writers.<br \/><br \/>ANGEL'S TIP (2008): Thrilled to spend the final hours of her spring break in the VIP room of an elite Manhattan club, fresh-faced Indiana college student Chelsea Hart remains behind when her girlfriends call it a night. The next morning, joggers find her body in East River Park, her blond hair brutally hacked off. NYPD Detective Ellie Hatcher believes the group of privileged men last seen plying Chelsea with free-flowing alcohol most likely includes a murderer. But after building a tight case against a young hedge-fund manager, Ellie has her doubts, because Chelsea's slaying is eerily similar to three other murders from nearly a decade ago. Continuing the investigation long after the department brass is satisfied with their case, hard-headed Ellie plunges into a late-night party world of conspicuous wealth and hedonistic consumption to catch the real killer--unaware that a psychopath is watching her every move...and eager to kill again.<br \/><br \/>212 (2010): In New York City, Nights Are Dangerous. Days Are Numbered. When New York University sophomore Megan Gunther finds personal threats posted to a Web site specializing in campus gossip, she's taken aback by their menacing tone. Someone knows her daily routine down to the minute and is watching her--but thanks to the anonymity provided by the Internet, the police tell her there's nothing they can do. Her friends are sure it's someone's idea of a joke, but when Megan is murdered in a vicious attack, NYPD Detective Ellie Hatcher is convinced that the online threats are more than just empty words. With smooth, straight-talking partner J. J. Rogan at her side, Ellie tries to identify Megan's enemies, but she begins to wonder if the coed's murder was more than just the culmination of a cyber obsession. Phone records reveal a link between Megan and a murdered real estate agent who was living a dangerous double life. The detectives also learn that the dead real estate agent shared a secret connection to a celebrity mogul whose bodyguard was mysteriously killed a few months earlier. And when Megan's roommate suddenly disappears, they know they have to find her before another young woman dies.

This addictive thriller from acclaimed suspense writer Alafair Burke draws its details from the author's own experiences as a criminal law professor and deputy district attorney, creating an exhilarating, true-to-life tale of crime and its consequences that is perfect for fans of Laura Lippman, Harlan Coben, and Burke's breakout standalone thriller Long Gone.Even a perfect family has its secrets. Sixteen-year-old Julia Whitmire appeared to have everything: a famous father, a luxurious Manhattan town house, a coveted spot at the elite Casden prep school. When she is found dead in her bathtub, a handwritten suicide note left on her bed, her parents insist that their daughter would never take her own life. But Julia's enviable world was more complicated than it seemed. The pressure to excel at Casden was enormous. Abuse of prescription drugs ran rampant among students. And a search of Julia's computer reveals that she'd been engaged in a dangerous game of cyberbullying against an unlikely victim. NYPD detective Ellie Hatcher is convinced the case is a suicide, but she knows from personal experience that a loving family can be the last to accept the truth. As she is pressured to pursue a case she doesn't believe in, she is pulled into Julia's inner circle--an eclectic mix of precocious teenagers from Manhattan's most privileged families as well as street kids from Greenwich Village. But when the target of Julia's harassment continues to receive death threats, Ellie is forced to acknowledge that Julia may have learned the hard way that some secrets should never be told.","images":[],"asin":"0062208381","parent_asin":"0062208381","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1401392251000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":6014,"length_group":3}

{"rating":3,"title":"False Witness: A Novel (Detective Cooper Devereaux) by Andrew Grant  Har,dcover – January 2, 2018","text":"Set in Birmingham Alabama. I wounder why the author chose Birmingham over any other American city? I have never been and I don't feel like the novel utilized it all that much. On to the characters, I didn't find them all that interesting. I also didn't find them to be decent people.  I also didn't find Deveraux's baby mama or her story-line all that interesting. Same goes for the blackmail thread, they both were distracting and overwrought.However if you are looking for a lightweight quick police procedural you could enjoy it.<br \/><br \/>Detective Cooper Devereaux series:<br \/>False Positive (2015): Alabama detective Cooper Devereaux makes no apologies for his luxe lifestyle or the way he does his job. Most cops haven’t lived the kind of life he has—starting out as an orphan, raised by a grizzled cop savior—and most don’t use his kind of high-risk tactics. But he may have met his match in fellow detective Jan Loflin, who’s fresh off a long undercover stint in Vice when they’re partnered on a case that will test them both beyond their direst nightmares. A seven-year-old boy has disappeared from his home in the Birmingham suburbs. But the more Devereaux digs into the missing child’s background, the more he discovers about his own, eventually shaking loose a series of harrowing truths—about bloodlines, mass murder, obsession, and what two damaged detectives have in common with the innocent victim they’re so desperate to save. This twisty page-turner—the debut of the Detective Cooper Devereaux series—hurtles at a mile a minute through an action-packed search for a missing child, culminating in an ending that no reader will see coming.<br \/><br \/>False Friend (2017): An arsonist is targeting schools in Birmingham, Alabama—with devastating effect. Detective Devereaux—a man you can’t quite trust and should never ignore—must put a stop to the elusive pyromaniac’s reign of terror before more damage is done. Or worse, before students’ lives are lost. But as Devereaux sifts through the ashes of the case, a grisly discovery at a burned-out school sends the investigation spiraling in a new, terrifying direction. The detective and his partner are dragged into a nightmare world by revelations of gruesome rituals, the disappearance of local citizens, and allegations against city officials of shocking crimes that stretch back decades.<br \/>With innocent lives on the line, progress is hampered by friction between the police department and the FBI, and interference from factions of the local underworld complicate matters further. Devereaux doesn’t make excuses for his willingness to work outside the lines, but just as he needs to be at the top of his game, he’s rocked by echoes from his troubled past that threaten to engulf his daughter and girlfriend—and fracture the life he’s only recently begun to rebuild.","images":[],"asin":"0399594337","parent_asin":"0399594337","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1550106238741,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2841,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Must I say nice things?","text":"TLDR:  Too much sex, too much illogic, no depth of character, but interesting idea and well edited tale.  Can't recommend.<br \/><br \/>***<br \/>So the TLDR pretty much explains how I felt.  Honestly I was very hesitant to pick up this book based on the description and realizing that there was a risk the author was going for a subversion of expectations.  And that much we definitely get.  The \"hero\" ends up a slave to oversexed women who treat him more as a prop for fetish sex than a real character.  And there is a lot of this.  Honestly it surprises me to say, but there was more sex and more kinky sex in this book than I find in the more juvenile harem fantasy works that permeate the LitRPG world.<br \/><br \/>Now this isn't a LitRPG tale, although there are a ton of creatures that appear to have been inspired by a Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting.  Honestly, because of the way the plot unfolded this story could have been set anywhere.  Sure its underground and primarily in some massive city in the underworld, but this could have been set in some tropical rainforest or great steppe desert for all that the setting mattered.<br \/><br \/>And that probably is what I took away from this tale.  The hero despite a few scenes that are meant to be tense never appears to be in great danger.  The other characters are bland and never offer enough pathos to engage with the plot, and the sex was excessive and dragged down an otherwise interesting plot.<br \/><br \/>Some people are going to say offer many superlatives about the plot and sex and....  That is their opinion.  I did not really enjoy this tale, although it is not terrible.  I just felt that the bondage\/sex slavery antics were off-putting and unnecessary.  Honestly, I had forgotten that the author was Regina Watts, but after the second or third sex scene my thought was \"this is written by a sexually frustrated woman who wants to dominate a man\".  While I guess writing out your deviant sexual fantasies can be good therapy, I don't have to enjoy reading it.","images":[],"asin":"B08T3LC4VG","parent_asin":"B08T3LC4VG","user_id":"AE747CPTU3RCQNGPY4OYSSKJHKQQ","timestamp":1614025991267,"helpful_vote":24,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2033,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Why do People Surf the Way They Do?","text":"Online web surfing is a popular pastime and the sites that individuals visit, the time they spend in specific web sites, and the things they search for in search engines are often quite revealing. The internet is not only an important source of business for online retailers, it is also fast becoming a means as a social outlet and continues to be a place to search for answers to questions. Buying is still an important internet use, but the greatest internet growth trend in the past five years is the social networking site. Sites like Myspace.com, Facebook.com, and others have exploded in popularity. What these sites mean to the future of the internet and why people use search engines the way they do is the main focus of this book and some of its discoveries are quite interesting and very revealing.<br \/><br \/>People visit the internet for a multitude of reasons. Some of the more obvious include purchasing and looking up answers to questions. But the internet has evolved in many directions and people use this important communication medium for many other purposes, like keeping up with their favorite celebrities, checking sports scores, monitoring business activities, and much more. Click isn't concerned so much with the reasons why people use the internet for these tasks instead of consulting other sources like newspapers (convenience is the most likely reason); rather, it is concerned with discovering the different triggers that cause some people to want to learn more about a celebrity, seek out information on a specific item of merchandise, or make a purchase of something before most of the population. Why, for example, do prom dress searches peak in January each year when the actual prom is held many months later? Why are visits to adult sites so common on Saturday, Friday, and Thursday yet they take a huge dip on Sunday and Monday? These and other questions are answered in the pages of Click, and the answers might surprise many readers.<br \/><br \/>To allow the reader to visually understand what some of the facts are talking about, some of the pages include a table or line graph showing the trends spoken about on each of the pages. I found these graphics very helpful because they show exactly what the author is referring to when he mentions the seasonal fluctuations in certain web site visits. By viewing a graph, it is easy to see the changes that take place from month to month and the volatility of these changes clearly illustrate the extremes or lack of extreme of a trend.<br \/><br \/>Web surfing and the sites people visit are often very telling and this is the main reason why Click was written. Phone surveys and traditional means of research may or may not reveal a person's true motives or true intentions. It is very easy to say what one thinks the interviewer wants to hear, even if it isn't really the truth. But with the relative privacy of the internet, people are free to surf as they please, with only the speed of their fingers on the keyboard or the quickness of the click of the mouse standing between the web surfer and the virtually infinite amount of information available on the internet. Because of this, what people say and what they actually do are often two very different things and a person's web surfing habits often reveal more than any other type of study ever could. One example quoted in the book is phobias. People say that certain things scare them more than anything and there are lists compiled that show the most common phobias among Americans. However, research into actual web searches using the word phobia reveals a very different list. Could it be that the fears we have are different from those we say we have? Or, do we like to use the internet to lookup facts about phobias, even though we don't necessarily suffer from them?<br \/><br \/>Overall, Click is a pretty good book about the internet and what our searching patterns say about us as a people. In many instances, the book seems to end an important thought right when it had just gotten started and it sometimes fails to examine everything relating to a specific web surfing discovery like it should, in order to draw the most accurate conclusion. But Click is still a good book about the internet and it offers many interesting answers to trivia questions about the world of the internet, its changing face over the past decade, and what the future holds for this very important communication tool.","images":[],"asin":"1401323049","parent_asin":"1401323049","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1220881283000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4445,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Extremely Poor Mystery, But With Darned Good Recipes","text":"BANANA CREAM PIE MURDER (A HANNAH SWENSON MYSTERY) doesn't work very well as a standalone, unless you're mainly interested in the many scrumptious dessert, cookie, quick-dinner, and snack recipes.  It's puzzling that newlywed Hannah doesn't know much about her husband Ross' likes or dislikes; and that she's apparently seeking a subordinate wife's role in their marriage.  Hannah's confusion about what's expected of her in her new daily routine weakens her previously established character as a strong, independent, happy-though-single businesswoman.<br \/><br \/>As a reader, I couldn't help wondering whether author Joanne Fluke is already regretting having married Hannah off?  (This happened in the previous novel, the 19th novel of the series, [[ASIN:1617732184 The Wedding Cake Murder]].  I probably should have read it before this one, though the novels are usually okay as standalones.)<br \/><br \/>In the novel, Hannah's mother Delores hears a scream from the luxury condo below hers, the condo owned by her close friend Tori.  When Delores investigates, she discovers that the former actress has been murdered.  Delores calls in detective Mike (oddly keeping back Tori's appointment book, an obviously important piece of evidence, to show to Hannah, who is due back from her honeymoon).<br \/><br \/>Hannah takes over the amateurs' murder investigation, using overheard grocery store conversations, as well as tips from local gossipy waitresses, and some breaking and entering, to move the investigation forward.  Hannah gets help from Delores, Doc, Michelle, Norman, and other friends and relatives.  Food is featured in almost every chapter as the family shares meals; or as Hannah bribes sources with Cookie Jar cookies; or as Mike shows up at the Cookie Jar for coffee and goodies, and to warn Hannah to stay clear of his murder investigation.  As Hannah's investigation advances, Ross becomes somewhat distant, and Hannah begins to doubt his love for her.<br \/><br \/>As a mystery, this is an extremely poor effort, but the recipes are darned good.  (You do need to enjoy reading about food to be able to enjoy this cozy mystery.)  Hannah's existing fans will certainly want to read this book to find out about the honeymoon, and to keep up with the ongoing  events in Hannah's somewhat weird extended family.  However, I hope that the next series book will be a much better mystery.","images":[],"asin":"1617732206","parent_asin":"1617732206","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1485827993000,"helpful_vote":14,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2394,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Most Designs Use Garter Stitch in Traditional Ways","text":"Where is the garter stitch &#34;revival&#34;?  Alas, most of the patterns in GARTER STITCH REVIVAL: 20 CREATIVE KNITTING PATTERNS FEATURING THE SIMPLEST STITCH are for cowls, ponchos, shawls, wraps, shrugs, and scarves--all fairly-easy-to-knit wearables that traditionally incorporate garter stitch, because they're good beginner projects, or require knitting a lot of fabric.<br \/><br \/>I'd hoped that this book would change my mind about garter stitch (which I've never cared for), but that didn't happen.  Of the 20 designs in this collection, the only one that I might want to knit is the intriguing Brioche Boardwalk Cowl (a cowl with a sectioned band of reversible stripes done in orange and blue, by Jessie Ksanznak; see my customer photo).<br \/><br \/>The book's &#34;garter stitch&#34; designs are divided into three main categories:  Garter Stitch Details (6 designs); Garter Stitch in a Supporting Role (7 designs); and Garter Stitch All Over (7 designs).  The designs in the first two categories use garter stitch, but not enough of it to make you think of the finished items as garter-stitch knits.<br \/><br \/>The Garter Stitch All Over section includes only two sweaters: the Festival Halter Top (a very plain, sleeveless tee, by Sachiko Burgin), and the Autumn Evening Shrug (by Melissa LaBarre).  Both are decent knitted garments, but the fabric looks like ordinary garter stitch.<br \/><br \/>The Garter Stitch Details section has three sweaters with garter stitch decorative elements: the Seashell Dolman Tee (garter stitch columns at the waist, by Kiri FitzGerald-Hillier), the Asymmetrical Cropped Jacket (garter stitch back panel and button band, by Toby Roxane Barna), and the Just Peachy Saddle Shoulder Cardigan (wide garter stitch bands at waist and cuffs, by Kristen TenDyke).<br \/><br \/>The Garter Stitch in a Supporting Role section has two sweaters with garter stitch yokes and bands that contrast with the fabrics' main stitches (e.g., lace, brioche):  the Cotton Candy Mosaic Yoke Cardigan (colorful garter stitch yoke in Greek key mosaic bands, by Amy Gunderson), and the Santa Monica Cardigan (long cardigan with garter stitch back, by Holli Yeoh).<br \/><br \/>The book cover photo shows the Arrowhead Stole (by Courtney Spainhower), which is one of the many included shawl, cowl, and wrap designs.<br \/><br \/>As you would expect from an Interweave Press book, the designs have both written-out and charted instructions, accompanied by schematics.  In my opinion, the book's overall design isn't up to the usual Interweave Press standards, although the multiple photographs of the finished items are of the high quality you always expect from this publisher.  The skill level for these designs is  probably intermediate to advanced intermediate; a few of the scarves can probably be knit by adventurous beginners.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81tYMguhD9L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81tYMguhD9L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81tYMguhD9L._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1632502984","parent_asin":"1632502984","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1484853174000,"helpful_vote":24,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2842,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Second Book in Series About Investigators’ Hunt for Cult Leader Quinton Zane","text":"PROMISE NOT TO TELL is the second novel in the “Cutler, Sutter & Salinas” mystery\/thriller series about a trio of private investigators who are hunting a charismatic, manipulative cult leader (Quinton Zane).  It sort of works as a standalone, but it’s hard to commit to if you don’t know the backstory.  (I did not.)  If you’re interested in the series, start with [[ASIN:0515156353 When All the Girls Have Gone]], because the second novel is chock full of spoilers.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, a reclusive survivor of Zane’s cult (Hannah) commits suicide after spotting a person that she believes is Zane, who is apparently returning for the key to a cache of hidden cult money.  Before she dies, she paints a picture on the wall of her cabin, photographs the painting, mails the camera to another cult survivor (Virginia), and torches the cabin.  Virginia, who is an art gallery owner, subsequently hires the Cutler, Sutter & Salinas PI firm to determine whether Hannah was murdered, and to help unravel the meaning of Hannah’s final painting.<br \/><br \/>What follows is an extremely convoluted investigation, every bit as complicated as the one in [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]].  The book is well-written, but the characters spend a lot of time sizing one another up, talking about motives, and discussing relationships.  Also, the story skips forward and back, and repeats itself, which can be confusing to the reader, and which makes for a slow read.<br \/><br \/>The plot has lots of action, and the many threads are tied up more or less satisfactorily at the end, despite the story’s ending with a cliffhanger. However, I didn’t like any of the characters well enough to want to read any more books in the series. Jayne Ann Krentz may be a best-selling author, but I don’t care for her mystery\/thriller writing style.","images":[],"asin":"0399585273","parent_asin":"0399585273","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1537740871997,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1827,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Moderately interesting","text":"The book is pretty good at going into the scientific details which explain questions people ask, however, I really can't say I was that interested in wanting to know the details for many of the questions. But, some were interesting, like:<br \/><br \/>1. Why do darker alcoholic drinks produce worse hangovers? Because of the methanol they contain, as opposed to lighter drinks' ethanol.<br \/><br \/>2. Why do people have eyebrows?  Besides diverting sweat droplets, perhaps mostly to express emotions - like telegraphing friendly intentions for survival.<br \/><br \/>3. How fat would you have to be, to be bulletproof? Although the human body could never be totally bulletproof because of certain tissues and appendages, about 24 inches of flesh would protect against a 9-mm handgun.<br \/><br \/>4. How can a person reduce cellulite? By reduction in calories and exercise, that's it.<br \/><br \/>5. Does beheading (like with a guillotine) hurt? Yes, a few seconds.<br \/><br \/>6. Is green potato skin toxic? Although the color is harmless, chlorophyll, it is a warning of a toxic level of solanine.  A lethal dose for a 160 lb. person would be about five pounds of such potatoes.<br \/><br \/>7. Does anything eat wasps? Yes, what doesn't, is a better question. Frogs, goldfish and spiders do.<br \/><br \/>8. Does pickling cause vegetables to lose nutrition? Not much.<br \/><br \/>9.  Why do incandescent lightbulbs turn grayish over time? Evaporation of tungsten from the filament.<br \/><br \/>10. Why does sea look blue? Seawater absorbs all wavelengths of light except blue, which is scattered.<br \/><br \/>11. Can two galaxies collide? Although space is expanding, galaxies have their own trajectories which are pulled about by the gravity of other galaxies, and therefore, can collide.<br \/><br \/>12. Why is it colder at the South Pole? Because of the high mountains.<br \/><br \/>13. Since wheels are so efficient in getting around, why didn't they evolve in nature? Although bacteria have flagellum and there exist tumbleweeds in nature, for humans - every part is either connected to or communicates with other parts, so wheels would cause all kinds of entanglements. However, with humans, evolution has allowed them to make wheels.<br \/><br \/>So, for me, the book does make for a fun read, as long as I skimmed over several of the questions and their answers.","images":[],"asin":"0743297261","parent_asin":"0743297261","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1241300718000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2354,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Here's to a Healthy Heart","text":"Cooking is great for creative types. There is no end to the possibilities and there are many directions one can go when crafting and perfecting a recipe. Making up something can be fun, but it is also nice when someone else has already done the work for you, especially when you have a specific dietary need. And a good cookbook for a specific need is the 30 Minute Heart Healthy Cookbook.<br \/><br \/>I received a copy of this book from the publisher and I like how the book presents some background information before it launches into the recipes. The cookbook is, after all, dedicated to heart health so it makes sense to discuss exactly what it means for a recipe to be heart healthy. The book does exactly that when it discusses popular heart- healthy eating patterns, the principles of heart healthy eating, etc. Some of the advice in this section is debatable, but the bulk of it is good and can help those who are looking to improve heart health through better eating.<br \/><br \/>Moving to the recipes, this cookbook is divided into sections for breakfast and smoothies; salads, starters, and side dishes; vegetarian and vegan; seafood; poultry; meat; snacks and sweet treats; and staples. I like that the cookbook includes a variety and I know that those of the vegetarian\/vegan persuasion will like that the cookbook has a separate section for those types of foods.<br \/><br \/>Each of the recipes in this book includes a description, ingredients, step by step instructions, nutritional facts; and sometimes tips on flavor boosting, ingredients, and substitutions. I have tried a few of the smoothies- I always seem to start with smoothies when I get a cookbook- and I have liked the results. The instructions are good, too, as they step you through the process.<br \/><br \/>One area where this cookbook lacks is illustrations. There is a single illustration at the beginning of each chapter for one of the recipes, and that is it. I like the visual appeal of illustrations- they go far in convincing me to give something a try. This cookbook is not a good option if you like to see the end result before you decide to pursue making the food or drink.<br \/><br \/>Eating heart- healthy foods is a good idea for everyone. I don’t have any heart issues, but I’m not going to wait for problems to develop- I’m taking steps now to reduce sodium and eat better foods to prolong heart healthiness. The 30 Minute Heart Healthy Cookbook is good for finding heart- friendly recipes and for crafting food dishes that don’t take long to make. I would like more illustrations and, as I said before, there is some debatable info in the front of the book. But this is still a good cookbook overall and perfect for those who want to reduce unhealthy fats and improve heart health.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61pf5uPm8TL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61pf5uPm8TL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61pf5uPm8TL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1641526327","parent_asin":"1641526327","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1572714378507,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2771,"length_group":3}

Accurate and timely cultural info is one of the first things I look for, along with detailed descriptions of local cuisine, off-the-beaten path suggestions, and a clean layout with clear maps. I write and design technical books for a living, so I tend to look at layout from a publisher's perspective (fonts, readability, choice of graphics and placement).<br \/><br \/>I've used several Lonely Planet guidebooks in the last two years, so when I opened Lonely Planet Croatia, I was surprised to see the lack of graphics. The only color photos to be found in 346 pages of text are in the first 30 pages. The extremely monochromatic and text-heavy design (printed in a small font) makes for laborious reading (to compare, I read this side by side with [[ASIN:1612381901 Rick Steves' Croatia and Slovenia]], which was inviting and made for fascinating reading cover to cover). This is unfortunate, because there is a wealth of information here: historical and cultural background on Croatia, including a very detailed timeline from 300BC to the present, architecture in Croatia, the environment, etc., but I found I only able to read in limited increments and had to come back to the book later.<br \/><br \/>Descriptions for individual sights \/ attractions are generally very thorough, labeling each (art gallery, museum, cemetery, etc.). Restaurant options include local Croatian food as well as a mix of international at a range of prices.  There's a young and hip vibe; you'll find sidebars on beach clubbing and the hottest bars. You'll also find handy survival info (local internet access, laundry, medical services, etc.) for each destination as well as a survival guide (with the interesting suggestion of volunteering at a local vulture center or a refuge for young bears) and a whirlwind overview of Croatian. One nice feature is that Lonely Planet Croatia goes into much more detail into areas not frequently visited on group tours (i.e., inland Croatia away from the Dalmatian Coast, such as Slavonia and Zagorje.<br \/><br \/>If the layout had been broken up differently (including more color graphics to break up the monotony of the small font), I feel that this would have been more user friendly. There is a lot of good info here,  but it tends to get lost in the fray. There is also no separate pull-out map as with other Lonely Planet titles I've purchased.

{"rating":3,"title":"Hit or miss -- a real mixed bag ...","text":"I've used the Lonely Planet guides for years, and they're usually quite good.  And I LOVE taking road trips, so anything that helps with planning is a good thing.<br \/><br \/>This new release from LP is quite good in certain areas, and not so good in others.  It's clear there were multiple authors with very different approaches\/insights.  Some chapters are filled with towns and attractions that are \"off the beaten path,\" or less obvious; others contain the same old tired tourist traps, with no real new and exciting places to go and things to see.<br \/><br \/>I decided to check out the treatment of places I'm most familiar with:  Pacific NW (specifically WA state), California (specifically northern CA), and the Great Plains.  I grew up in the midwest, live in CA for 28 yrs, and now call the Pacific NW home.<br \/><br \/>The good stuff:  the Pacific NW section is good, as far as it goes.  It doesn't include a lot of \"trips,\" but the included trips are detailed enough, and include enough esoteric info to make them standouts.  The Cascade Drive and the Olympic Peninsula Loop are filled with enough detail to keep one occupied for 4 or 5 days (and I've done both of these trips).<br \/><br \/>The Great Plains trips are likewise detailed enough to spark interest.  Again, there aren't very many trips, and nothing, really, in Iowa (where I can personally recommend a day or two in the Amana Colonies), but the ones that are presented are quite good.<br \/><br \/>The California section was a definite let-down.  On the Pacific Coast Highways trip, for example, virtually every \"highlight\" is a well-known tourist mecca (Golden Gate Park?  Hearst Castle? Monterey Bay Aquarium?  really?  Nothing new here ...).  Even the more detailed San Francisco, Marin and Napa Loop contains very little that you couldn't find on the AAA website.  I really wanted to see more \"discoveries,\" not the same old stuff that's been written about in popular travel guides.<br \/><br \/>For the serious road tripper, I would invest instead in more localized guides at the regional, state, or city level.  I can definitely vouch for the Lonely Planet guides [[ASIN:1742203019 Lonely Planet Washington, Oregon & the Pacific Northwest (Travel Guide)]], [[ASIN:1741794064 Lonely Planet Yosemite, Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks (Travel Guide)]], and [[ASIN:1742207456 Lonely Planet British Columbia & the Canadian Rockies (Travel Guide)]], as I've used all three of these to plan trips.  FIgure out where you want to go, and get the local or regional Lonely Planet guide for that area, and I think you'll be happier.<br \/><br \/>This book works as an overview; not as a detailed trip planner.","images":[],"asin":"174220063X","parent_asin":"174220063X","user_id":"AHRGTIMQO47C2VLJILIDU53BQKSA","timestamp":1403752999000,"helpful_vote":14,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2673,"length_group":3}

The basic premise was strong and Chris the narrative character was a solid &#34;everyman&#34; type character.  The plot appeared to have lots of room for character growth.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately as Casey added more plot twists and events the story began to sink under the weight of the plot.  There were just too many little additions to the story that Casey tries to sneak in.  It overwhelmed any character development.<br \/><br \/>And that was what I remember most when I reached the end.  I wasn't happy to see the ending, or sad to think that my journey with the characters was done, but rather just tired of the story.  I couldn't hate the various villains, who were too often faceless and invisible.  Which was a problem in itself.  If the villains are largely faceless and invisible they can become too unreal for any suspension of disbelief.  That was a major factor here.  The way the bad guys were presented eventually reached a point where I just didn't care because I wasn't immersed in the story.  It was almost as if I was reading an old science or computer science textbook, although it wasn't meant to be that dry.<br \/><br \/>Casey is clearly a talented author.  Chris started out appearing to be a strong and interesting character and the &#34;voice&#34; used by the author is compelling, but the story needs to both carry the characters as well as be carried by them.  This story manages neither.  The plot is too complex to lift characters that don't have strong foundations while at the same time the lack of focus on the characters meant they couldn't really carry the plot through the many twists.<br \/><br \/>This will be a good read for lovers of superhero fiction as its close to being a four star, but I do warn that the story fades badly in the last third","images":[],"asin":"B00MGEUYSQ","parent_asin":"B00MGEUYSQ","user_id":"AE747CPTU3RCQNGPY4OYSSKJHKQQ","timestamp":1412813219000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1964,"length_group":3}

D in social psychology from the University of Kansas (1979 & 1980). His research has been funded by the National Science Foundation since 1989. He received an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship for collaborative research with psychologists in Germany and several grants from the Dutch government for collaborative research with psychologists in the Netherlands. He and his colleagues have played a major role in the development of Experimental Existential Psychology, an emerging sub-discipline of social psychology that applies rigorous experimental methods to the study of human confrontation with existential problems such as death, freedom, isolation, and nature. He teaches a variety of courses in social psychology.<br \/><br \/>Dr. Pyszczynski’s research is focused primarily on Terror Management Theory, which he developed with his colleagues Jeff Greenberg and Sheldon Solomon. Terror management theory is concerned with the role of self-esteem and cultural belief systems in providing protection against core human fears, especially the fear of death. Over the years Professor Pyszczynski and colleagues have explored the role of terror management processes in a wide range of topics, including self-esteem, self-deception, prejudice, interpersonal relations, altruism, aggression, sexual ambivalence, disgust, depression, anxiety disorders, trauma, unconscious processes, aging, human development, and terrorism. He has also conducted research on how people fool themselves into believing that their biased views follow logically from the available facts and on the role of self-regulatory processes in depression and other psychological disorders.","images":[],"asin":"1400067472","parent_asin":"1400067472","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1431407332000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1990,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"The shallow pursuit of Ms. Liberty...","text":"Garrison Keillor's Liberty follows Clint Bunsen's midlife crisis: at 60, he feels that his dull life in Lake Wobegon was a waste, has an affair with a woman half his age, and contemplates a) running away to California or b) running for Congress. As the chairman of the annual Fourth of July parade, he is obsessed with creating monumental parades that attract CNN coverage and celebrities, but the townsfolk resent his meddling and long to return to simpler festivities. Complicating the matter is the fact that Clint is having a fling with last year's Miss Liberty.<br \/><br \/>Like Keillor's other Lake Wobegon novels, Liberty is populated by a quirky supporting cast of grumpy farmers, very gloomy people of Norwegian \/ German descent, and crazy locals known for their wild and unpredictable behavior, but these are so removed from the narration that they are eclipsed by Clint, who isn't a strong enough narrator to carry the novel. We hear briefly from Clint's long-suffering wife Irene, from a crazy gun-toting conspiracy theory bachelor, and from several politicians, but Clint is the main source of the observations regarding Lake Wobegon and its annual parade.<br \/><br \/>The actual action is slight and occurs towards the end; the rest of the story is devoted to Clint's midlife crisis as he contemplates how his life could have turned out differently if he'd stayed in California after the Navy. Guilted into returning home, Clint has been the main mechanic at Bunsen Motors for many years, and now his brother is retiring and wants him to buy the business. Clint has always resented being a mechanic, and wants to escape. His children are grown up and living on their own, and he's never had a deep relationship with his wife of over three decades. Clint receives DNA results that he isn't in fact 100% Norwegian. As part of this crisis, Clint reimagines himself as a passionate Latin lover through poetry, so his poems and narrations are increasingly sprinkled with basic Spanish. His newfound heritage increases his sense of isolation and resentment at Lake Wobegon, more so as he has been made to resign by the committee. Along the way, Keillor makes several pointed political statements, including an incident that's an obvious nod to Larry Craig's arrest in an airport bathroom for solicitation.<br \/><br \/>Liberty was simply a so-so read due to the lack of secondary characters and the fact that a large portion of the novel is narration via Clint's thoughts instead of action. His midlife crisis was handled tenderly, but Clint's personality made it hard to root for him. This wasn't one of my favorite Keillor Lake Wobegon novels, but it's a nice read on a rainy day.","images":[],"asin":"0670019917","parent_asin":"0670019917","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1225538277000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2686,"length_group":3}

The knitted models are NOT photographed on location.  Generally the designs include \"Scottish\" elements, such as tartan patterns, Aran cables, and Fair Isle colorwork motifs.  I have no idea what the \"Twist\" mentioned in the book's subtitle might be, because none of the cabled designs seem to use any new or unusual knitting techniques.  There is minimal description of each pattern, no discussion of \"Scottish\" knitting per se, and only a very general two pages of \"knitting know-how\" at the back.<br \/><br \/>The book cover shows two of the prettier sweater designs (\"Portree Sweater\" and \"Ross Cardigan\").  The colorways in these sweaters are typical--overall the colorways used in the book's designs seem rather odd to me:  gray and black; predominately pink and green; large areas of red, green, gold, and white.  Because SCOTTISH KNITS strikes me as just another pattern collection intended to sell Rowan yarn (Fine Tweed, Felted Tweed, and Tweed), I rate it generously at 3 stars (\"it's okay\" on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1596688513","parent_asin":"1596688513","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1360290035000,"helpful_vote":43,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1590,"length_group":3}

{"rating":3,"title":"Templates Do the Pattern-Writing Math for Different Yarn Gauges","text":"The NEW KNITTER'S TEMPLATE is a book of charts intended for experienced knitters to use in designing various styles of garments, in yarns of different gauges, to fit bust\/chest sizes 30\" to 60\".  The book is not so much about achieving custom fit, as it is about telling a knitter how many stitches to cast on, increase, and decrease to obtain the desired size and shape of a standard knitted garment component (e.g., back, front, sleeve) when using different gauges of yarn.<br \/><br \/>The authors provide a schematic \"Style Diagram\" drawing showing basic knitted garment styles (e.g., straight body back, v-neck front, cap sleeve).  This schematic is used in conjunction with a \"Blank Pattern Worksheet\" and \"The Templates\" to create garments with specific bust\/chest measurements using yarns of different gauges.  The knitter takes her\/his body measurements, selects a style out of the possible components, and then chooses a bust\/chest size depending on the amount of ease desired.  At this point, the knitter goes to the template for the yarn gauge (e.g., 5-1\/2 stitches and 7-1\/2 rows equals 1 inch), and finds the column headed by the selected bust\/chest size (e.g., 36 inches).  The knitter can then find the number of stitches to cast on, increase, and decrease (including number of times to increase and decrease) for each standard-shaped component part for the selected style.  The knitter then writes these numbers down in the appropriate areas of the pattern worksheet.  Voila!  The knitter now has a pattern for the project.<br \/><br \/>Basically, the templates do the math for the knitter.  They substitute for a software \"sloper\" (e.g., Cochenille's top-of-the-line \"Garment Designer\"), which will write out knitting instructions after the knitter selects a style and inputs figures for body measurements and yarn gauge into appropriate fields.  But unlike the software programs, the NEW KNITTER'S TEMPLATE does NOT give templates for garments that will \"custom fit\" persons with \"non-standard\" body measurements (e.g., small bust, wide hips).  Instead, the templates are based only on bust\/chest size and standard garment component shapes.  If a knitter has wide hips and simply follows the directions for the bust\/chest measurement, the knitter will end up with a garment that is too narrow at the hips.<br \/><br \/>The NEW KNITTER'S TEMPLATE does include a few pages of general discussion about adding ease to various styles, to help the knitter choose the appropriate template to follow in compensating for different body types.  However, I found the book to be difficult to use, and to be little more than a collection of pattern-writing charts.  For these reasons, I rate it at 3 stars (\"it's okay\" on the official Amazon scale).  If you're looking for a book that will really help you achieve a custom fit, by making a personal pattern based on your specific body measurements, then you might want to consider Jean Frost's excellent [[ASIN:193306420X Custom Knit Jackets: Casual to Couture]].","images":[],"asin":"1604680105","parent_asin":"1604680105","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1343956394000,"helpful_vote":15,"verified_purchase":true,"length":3013,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Mainly an Italian Cookbook","text":"Mediterranean cuisine encompasses a number of different nationalities and styles. This includes Italian, Spanish, Greek, northern African cuisines like Moroccan, and a few others. I looked to this book as a good overview for Mediterranean. This book does have coverage for a number of different cuisines that would be considered Mediterranean, but it focuses heavily on Italian dishes, While that’s not necessarily a bad thing, it does mean that this book misses its intended mark.<br \/><br \/>The book is divided into seven chapters: “Where to Begin”, Three-Ingredient Snacks and Cocktails”, “Salads and Soups”, “Beans, Grains and Bready Things”, “Colorful Pastas”, “Gathering Dishes” and finally “Desserts”. For the most part the recipe division is logical and makes good sense. There is obviously a little overlap between chapters which is to be expected. Now, that said, if the breakdown was by nationality instead there’s be a large chapter for Italian dishes and a scattering of others.<br \/><br \/>So, distribution aside… The recipes in this collection are good, at least the ones I have tried. These aren’t all simple and easy ones, though, and some take some fiddling or require ingredients that are less common than what you may typically have on hand (at least that’s the case in my kitchen). This should not come as a surprise, though, as such cuisine is often seafood-based or uses seasonal vegetables that aren’t always available year-round.<br \/><br \/>The book is full of nice, full-color photographs. Not every recipe has a picture with it, but most do and this really makes this book a pleasure to browse and to get ideas from. There’s a saying that you eat with your eyes first, and that is certainly true with this book.<br \/><br \/>This is not a bad cookbook. It’s actually a good cookbook, but it does not cover the Mediterranean cuisines as evenly as it could. It is mainly an Italian cookbook with a few other recipes thrown in here and there.","images":[],"asin":"1558329994","parent_asin":"1558329994","user_id":"AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ","timestamp":1607184397577,"helpful_vote":15,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1963,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Lincoln Defends Unpopular Accused Killer in Springfield in 1838","text":"FINAL RESTING PLACE:  A LINCOLN AND SPEED MYSTERY is the third novel in this series, which is loosely based on the actual close friendship that existed between Abraham Lincoln and Kentucky native Joshua Speed.  The story is set in 1838 in Springfield, Illinois, at a time when Lincoln had an active law practice, was running for the Illinois state legislature, and was engaging in debates with Stephen A. Douglas (the “Little Giant”) on behalf of the Whigs.<br \/><br \/>The plot takes elements lifted from real people, real events, and a real trial, and mixes them up to create a wholly fictional, new murder mystery that has Lincoln (1) endangered by a mysterious enemy, (2) defending an unpopular accused killer at trial, (3) debating Douglas and his Democrats, (4) courting local belle Margaret Owens, and (5) serving as a second in a duel.  The genuine history is fully explained in the author’s concluding “Historical Note”, although this note is rather light on the true history of Lincoln’s love interests.<br \/><br \/>Generally I’m not crazy about historical mysteries that take as many liberties as this one does with the real events, but my main quarrel with the novel is that it’s slow-moving and mostly boring.  The conclusion is especially disappointing—too many plot threads are tied up in too few pages, and Lincoln’s last-minute rescue at the very end is NOT believable.  (No spoiler here—of course Lincoln survives the events of this book, because he wasn’t assassinated until 1865.)<br \/><br \/>I enjoyed the previous series novel, [[ASIN:B01H082E5I These Honored Dead]], but after this one, I’m no longer interested in the series.  Still, I am greatly indebted to this novel for the quite curious historical fact that the highly respected Douglas had a habit of sitting on other men’s laps while arguing courtroom cases!","images":[],"asin":"1683315987","parent_asin":"1683315987","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1527371838617,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1836,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Enjoyable Novel - Interesting Style (see review)","text":"3.5 stars, rounded down for me.  Love at Deep Dusk is a story of Leah and John, high school sweethearts from a small town in Central Pennsylvania.  We meet them first just before they start dating, Leah from a home with a controlling but loving mother and a father who is more nurturing.  John, the only child to two ice cold parents we only know through him.  She's brilliant to his smartness. She goes to Harvard and then on to a law career.  He goes to Penn State and becomes a favorite English teacher. They end up together almost by chance and back home in Woodson. The story, for reasons I can't completely figure out, is compelling.  I say this because it is such a spare piece, the writing done in a few paragraphs at a time, chronological but separated loosely by topic.  Several paragraphs in a row get you through most of college.  One can jump suddenly to news someone's dying or that a teacher is having an affair with a student and never gets outed, or that Jennifer, a baby Leah's brother saved from a fire is gay and living in Philadelphia. There are no connectors, little emotion.  It is all narrative, but almost like an outline of what happened to the players in the book.  This usually is the sign of a writer who has not learned his\/her craft.  But it sort of works here and I wasn't angrily tossing the book down or talking out loud to myself about how I would edit this. I read this book initially because I'm a lawyer who grew up in Pennsylvania and when I researched the author I was fascinated that he is a Circuit Court of Appeals judge and this is his first foray into fiction.  It was a bonus, as I started reading, that the mythical town, Woodson, is in Central Pennsylvania, where I grew up, went to college and practiced law.  Here and there, some lawyer words appear, but they did not detract.  Overall, this was a book I wanted to finish and a style that is original, if at times odd in the way the story moves forward and if at times the characters make no sense at all emotionally.  I was told what Leah felt, but not in her words, or her mind. That's how the whole book is.  We are on the outside hearing a description of each thing that happens, each character's feelings, the way small towns work, etc.  It's not really a romance novel, for which I am grateful, nor would I call it historical fiction.  I'd call it \"contemporary literature\" or literary fiction.  But is is both a good story and an interesting approach to fiction. It's also a quick read.  So, see what you think.  I do recommend it.","images":[],"asin":"1620065762","parent_asin":"1620065762","user_id":"AEZ26WGWJ3EOQ4KWSHG77HJAG4EA","timestamp":1645654393182,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2538,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"A clinical look at what companies might do to help practitioners (cops, pilots, nurses, etc.) responsible for a tragedy","text":"I selected this book for review because I was interested in user stories of how people get through being a second victim. For instance, my best friend in the whole world committed suicide and at one point I felt guilty I could not prevent that.  An acquaintance of mine was brutally murdered (stabbed over 41 times) and I wanted to understand all the emotions a parent goes through. Also, while on the way work one day, a middle-aged man ran in front of a truck (suicide) a few minutes before I passed him as a passenger in a bus.  I always wondered how the truck driver coped.<br \/><br \/>Nevertheless, this book is not about any of that.  It's a clinical look at what companies might do to help practitioner (doctors, pilots, nurses, cops, etc.) second victims cope with a tragedy they caused without blame or with minimal blame.  There are some brief stories of these second victims which I found to be the highlight of this book because I could get into the mind of the second victim but that was to support the argument of why it second victims should be treated differently.  Societies put blame on second victims and have drifted away from calling things accidents. As a result, corporations and facilities do not learn from their  mistakes.<br \/><br \/>The book talks about the clinical implications of trauma, guilt, investigation, justice, retribution, etc.  In summary, this 100-page text is a good read but it really was not for me.  I'd believe people who are treating second victims would find the most benefit from reading this (5 stars).  People who are the second victims themselves might find a benefit (3-4 stars). However, people like me who wanted a text that delved into the mind of the second victim would probably rate this (2-3 stars).  At the current price of $31.93, I also feel this book is three-times what I would have paid had I purchased it. It is well-written, I liked it, but it did not achieve the goal I expected. What I learned from this book is that society, corporations, medical faculties, etc. do not want to learn from their mistakes.  Instead they are more likely to blame the second victim and seek to punish them without providing them the support that is desperately needed.","images":[],"asin":"146658341X","parent_asin":"146658341X","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1412474206000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2218,"length_group":3}

{"rating":3,"title":"San Francisco Bay Area  Setting Is Not Enough","text":"The San Francisco Bay Area setting is not enough to salvage this thriller.  In it, Harlan Donnally--yet another retired homicide detective turned vigilante--decides to honor an old friend's deathbed request and deliver a letter to the sister the friend abandoned at a Berkeley commune in 1965.  When Donnally learns that the sister was murdered 10 years later, he embarks on an investigation of the more-than-30-year-old \"cold case\".  Soon he uncovers a terrible act of deceit:  a violent, mentally ill man was falsely accused of the murder, declared incompetent to stand trial, and committed to a mental hospital to keep the case from ever going to trial or being fully investigated.<br \/><br \/>Donnally's investigation turns into a travelogue of sorts: it takes the detective from Mt. Shasta to downtown Berkeley, courthouses in San Francisco and Oakland, a homeless encampment in Golden Gate Park, Hunter's Point, a Ft. Bragg commune, a home in Hollywood Hills, a Vancouver religious community, and a Cancun sex-traffickers' complex.  As the plot unfolds, Donnally learns that the act of deceit was perpetrated by powerful local individuals who were engaged in recruiting young boys who were already victims of sexual abuse as prostitutes.  Donnally's complicated relationships with his long-time girl friend and his famous Hollywood filmmaker father are explored in subplots.<br \/><br \/>Author Steven Gore is a competent thriller writer who knows how to keep his readers turning the pages.  However, the story jumps around a lot, and can be hard to track because of the myriad of characters that figure significantly in the plot (Mauricio, Anna, Sonny, Charles\/Rover, Father Phil, Brother Melvin, Trudy, Bear, Perkins, Pipkins, Blaine, Sherwyn, R2T2, Gregorio, Jago, Lalo, Beto, Janie, and a few others whose names I can't remember right now).  Also, Donnally has hard-to-believe, near-superhero abilities, when it comes to escaping a hit man, carrying out a burglary, and rescuing someone from a criminal complex that has military-level security.<br \/><br \/>Because the plot was interesting enough to keep me reading, I give this book 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3 stars ('it's okay\").  Probably I won't bother to look for the next \"Harlan Donnelly Novel\",  though, because I didn't find the Donnally character to be particularly interesting.","images":[],"asin":"0062025066","parent_asin":"0062025066","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1319136422000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2344,"length_group":3}

The book would have been much better if it had been trimmed significantly - maybe 100 pages shorter. As with any fictionalized account of real people's stories, there is certainly some speculation and guess work by the author as to what may or may not have happened, been said, been felt or thought by Ms. Young, Mr Gable, Mr Tracy or any of the other people in Loretta Young's world.

But I felt I was kept at arm's length from the heart of this book, like I should have been content being just a spectator when I really wanted to be a participant.<br \/><br \/>The main character of this novel is Cassie Clairborne, who I suppose (to the casual observer) could be called a pool hustler.  I love how she explains herself, though:  \"`I play American pool, not English billiards, and I'm not a shark.  That would be a person who pretended not to be a good player, then stole the money of her opponent.  I just announce myself, I say I've come to a place to play their best, and for money, and that person is called.

She is complicated, so tough, so tender.  Your heart breaks for her.  I thought there would be many more poolhall scenes, but the fact that she plays pool is really just a consequence of her life experience, not the center of it.  Pool is how she processes all of the pain and hurt and confusion she feels from the rest of her world.<br \/><br \/>I also love Kimmel's writing style, which is at times very lyrical.  The pace of the plot, though, was what killed it for me.  I joked with my husband that this book - even at a mere 269 pages - is a \"skimmer's paradise,\" meaning that you could skim several large passage (even pages!) and jump back in with the plot having only moved forward just a skoche.

{"rating":3,"title":"How to Save Money and Get More from Your Next Cruise","text":"Cruises are great fun but they can also be rather costly. Cruise ships have a seemingly endless number of services ready for purchase and if consumers aren't careful, they can easily double the original cost of a cabin when overall costs are added together. Fortunately, there are ways to get more for less and Cruise Power is here to help, with simple advice that can help cruisers get more than they expected from a cruise while still keeping costs under control.<br \/><br \/>Cruise Power's author has years and years of experience on cruise ships and he shares some of his price- cutting and other wisdom on each page. The book talks about cabin selection, upgrades, shore excursions, frequent cruiser programs, and other things that can help consumers get more for less. It even comes with a smaller guidebook that offers tips aimed at helping you get invited to dine with the ship's captain. The advice is straight forward, the reading is simple, and cruise vacationers have much to gain by following what the book recommends.<br \/><br \/>I have taken a cruise or two in my day and some of the advice offered here is common sense, but other tidbits are not and new cruisers, in particular, stand the most to gain. How many are aware of the high cost of shore excursions and the better offers available for purchase off of the ship? How many realize that paying up- front for a cruise is a bad idea and that placing a deposit today with payment later is really the best way to go? I found a few useful facts and advice myself and I really like the cruise website recommendations. I had not heard of several of them and now that I have logged in and checked, they appear to be very useful.<br \/><br \/>Cruise Power is a good book for saving money on a cruise and discovering hidden perks, but one problem I have with the book is the briefness of its coverage and advice. The book is short and doesn't really have enough space to cover everything. Some money- saving topics are barely touched and others could use a little more thoroughness. Additional appendices could also make a difference. Still, if you need some basic tips on ways to cut costs and get more from your next cruise, this book can serve as a useful resource. It is short, but there is some good wisdom within and cruise vacationers will come out ahead if they follow the book's advice.","images":[],"asin":"1463557647","parent_asin":"1463557647","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1375208814000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2353,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Hopelessly Outdated, \"The Saint\" Belongs to Era of Pulp Fiction","text":"Leslie Charteris was a talented writer, and his memorable character (\"the Saint\") certainly deserved its immense, long-running popularity.  But \"the Saint\" belongs to the era of pulp fiction--when heroes in thrillers could be painted in very broad strokes, and plots could allow heroes to always wriggle out of ropes, escape from death traps, or save the day by showing up unexpectedly in an airplane with a machine gun at the last possible moment.<br \/><br \/>It seems pointless to try to revive \"the Saint\" for today's readers of thrillers.  Trash-talking, for \"the Saint\", means insulting bad guys by addressing them as \"precious\" or  \"sweetheart\", or by taunting them by \"coolly and sweetly\" predicting they will lose because he's a superior being who always wins. \"The Saint\" beats up bad guys because the bad guys deserve to be punished, and because he enjoys it.  \"The Saint\" has four helpers (his \"haloes\") who do his bidding because of \"the Saint's\" sheer force of character. Whenever \"the Saint's\" implausible plan goes awry, he thinks up another implausible plan, which works.  When bad guys tie up \"the Saint\", they always overlook the throwing knives that \"the Saint\" wears strapped to a forearm and an ankle. \"The Saint\" has a \"signature\" (a little stick drawing of a man with a halo) that supposedly strikes fear into the hearts of bad guys who receive the drawing by some means.  But for today's readers, the stick figure's oddly feminine pose totally destroys the effect.<br \/><br \/>Because the three included novellas are mildly entertaining but hopelessly outdated, I rate ENTER THE SAINT at 3 stars (\"It's okay\" on the Official Amazon Scale).","images":[],"asin":"1477842616","parent_asin":"1477842616","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1410672487000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1661,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"More Travelogue Than Mystery Novel; Short on Oliver's Bone Analysis","text":"SWITCHEROO, the 18th &#34;skeleton detective&#34; novel, is mostly a travelogue set in Jersey (in the Channel Islands).  The mystery plot is thin, and the story is padded out with a lot of descriptions of archeological sites, present-day buildings, unusual geographical features (e.g., tar pits), and restaurant meals enjoyed by the characters.  The mystery itself has an historical background, loosely tied to the German occupation of Jersey during World War II.<br \/><br \/>In the historical part of the novel, two Jersey families agree to swap their infant sons, so that the more sickly child can be evacuated to hoped-for safety in England until the coming German occupation is over.  Only the families and their lawyer know about this arrangement.  After the war, the evacuated parents return with the child to Jersey, and the parents who remained behind make good on their promise to deed over Jersey property in return for their child's safety.  The children grow up, but both are murdered (the bones of one are recovered from a tar pit), and their murders remain unsolved.<br \/><br \/>In the present-day bulk of the novel, a bored Gideon Oliver is recruited by a high-ranking Jersey politician (Rafe Carlisle) to examine the tar pit bones (which are purported to include some of his father's bones).  Rafe is a wealthy forensics enthusiast, and is curious to know what bone expert Oliver will have to say.  From the outset, Oliver is suspicious of the official findings--which determined that the tar pit bones were the bones from two persons of specific ages--because specific ages cannot be determined from the examination of bones alone.<br \/><br \/>As always happens in mystery novels, it would have been best if Rafe had let sleeping dogs lie.  Oliver's investigation naturally leads to another murder.  In the course of his investigation, he sees a lot of interesting Jersey buildings, eats some excellent Jersey food, and learns a lot about the history and political structure of Jersey.  Eventually Oliver solves the old, cold case, and the guilty present-day murderer is brought to justice.<br \/><br \/>I have read all, or nearly all, of the Gideon Oliver books, and found all of them, including this one, to be enjoyable.  However, SWITCHEROO is definitely NOT one of the best of the series.  Because it is slow-moving, has a thin mystery plot, and is somewhat lacking in Gideon Oliver's trademark skeleton analysis, I rate it at 3 stars (&#34;It's okay&#34; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1477827684","parent_asin":"1477827684","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1456599546000,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2503,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Unlikeable “Girl Reporter” Investigates Jockey’s Murder in 1962 Saratoga Springs Area","text":"A STONE’S THROW:  AN ELLIE STONE MYSTERY is a competently written mystery\/thriller—your basic PI procedural.  The PI is “girl reporter” Ellie Stone, a surprisingly thin-skinned Jewish lass (she’s outraged by fairly mild anti-Semitic jokes, and disapproving of any and all bad language). Her thin skin is surprising, because she drinks like a fish (there’s always a bottle of Dewars handy), and she considers herself “a modern girl” (she’ll sleep with a strange guy she met only hours before).<br \/><br \/>In the novel, newspaper reporter Ellie is drawn into the world of horse racing, as it supposedly existed around Saratoga Springs circa 1962.  When covering a fire at an abandoned horse barn, she stumbles upon two burnt bodies.  A fragment of unburnt racing silks on the jockey-sized male, and bits of red hair and fur on the normal-sized female, are just enough to launch Ellie’s quest to identify them.  Autopsies reveal that the pair were murdered.  Ellie uses her contacts with local police, gangsters, racehorse owners, track habitues, and addicted bettors to stay one step ahead of everyone else in getting the facts and publishing her stories ahead of the competition.<br \/><br \/>The writing is fine, but the plot is just barely interesting enough to keep the reader reading.  Ellie herself isn’t particularly likeable (the drinking doesn’t help).  Her behavior is often reckless (for example, she goes alone into the basement of a remote, derelict cottage), yet she’s constantly fearful that a stranger may break into her home.  Ellie does find a racehorse (the handsome Purgatorio) that takes a shine to her; but this isn’t very believable, given that Ellie knows next to nothing about horses or thoroughbred racing.<br \/><br \/>Perhaps the other novels in the Ellie Stone series are better, but this one’s a snooze.  It works fine as a standalone.","images":[],"asin":"1633884198","parent_asin":"1633884198","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1525629376867,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1859,"length_group":3}

I liked the premise of the story and although the cover art did not depict the nature of the book, I had no complaints there.<br \/>Cons: The shortening of her name to 'X' was annoying.

{"rating":3,"title":"Thinly Fictionalized Account of Cambodian Kidnapping of Italian\/American Spy","text":"SUPERNOTES, co-authored by &#34;Agent Kasper&#34; and Luigi Carletti, is a &#34;thriller based on the true story of Agent Kasper.&#34;  It's well-written, but it reads more like a nonfiction memoir than a fictional thriller.  Given that &#34;Agent Kasper&#34; is supposed to be an alias of &#34;a top-level undercover spy who worked for both the CIA and the Italian intelligence services&#34;, the reader is probably safe in assuming that this &#34;thriller&#34; is, in fact, a thinly fictionalized account of an actual kidnapping and lengthy Cambodian incarceration of an Italian\/American spy.<br \/><br \/>Being a news\/information junkie, I found this book highly disconcerting to read.  I really don't like filling my mind with suspect facts, and this book lacks an &#34;Author's Notes&#34; chapter--included in many historical-fact-based thrillers (e.g., [[ASIN:1250058449 The Patriot Threat: A Novel]])--to help the reader sort out fact from fiction.  If the authors wanted the world to know about, and believe in, the &#34;explosive secret&#34; that Kasper uncovered, it might have been better for them to write an openly nonfictional account.<br \/><br \/>In this book, the Italian owner (Agent Kasper) of a Phnom Penh bar is warned by a Cambodian senator that he needs to get out of Cambodia immediately.  Unfortunately, the warning comes too late, and Kasper is captured\/kidnapped by military personnel at the border.  His Italian family's wealth saves his life--as long as they can make payments to the captors, Kasper will be allowed to live.<br \/><br \/>Kasper is beaten and tortured, and imprisoned under the worst possible conditions.  He has been working with &#34;the Americans&#34; to discover the source of the &#34;supernotes&#34; (nearly perfect forgeries of U.S. currency) that are flooding Southeast Asia.  However, the Americans have callously abandoned him.  Italian diplomats merely look the other way, when informed of the Cambodians' kidnapping of an Italian citizen.  So it is up to Kasper's family, and the doggedly persistent lawyer that they hire, to obtain Kasper's release and his safe return to Italy.<br \/><br \/>Because SUPERNOTES isn't much of a thriller, and makes no attempt to help the reader sort fact from fiction, I rate it at a rather generous 3 stars (&#34;It's okay&#34; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"0385540078","parent_asin":"0385540078","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1452540559000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2341,"length_group":3}

{"rating":3,"title":"Seemed to lack something","text":"I guess after reading stories like Confessions of a D-list Supervillian and Wearing the Cape I have a slightly higher standard when it comes to superhero books than others.  This is an interesting story with an imaginative plot, but it seemed to lack something.<br \/><br \/>I'll admit that the main character didn't really draw me in.  He does grow quite a bit through the story and as she supposedly starts out as a 12 year old, some of his immaturity is understandable, but he also ends up just too weak a personality.  I was intriqued by his story, but not gripped by his trials and perils.<br \/><br \/>The rest of the cast seemed to come out of comic-book central casting.  Motives were almost mindlessly simple, something that more than one character noted in the later chapters.  The backstory of the universe adn the previous generations of super-villians was left remarkably undiscussed.  Many of the motives seemed more pro-forma than built out of some deep elaborate character personal involvement.<br \/><br \/>THis is a fast read and definitely interesting.  A teenager or a lover of comic-books will find it increbily fun to read, but someone who expects a bit more from his stories will likely end up feeling like the story isn't finished.

{"rating":3,"title":"The Story Was Decent ...","text":"For the first 3 or 4 chapters of this book, I was so certain I would never rate it above 2 stars. Once the story actually started unfolding, it was much more interesting and I was actually able to get through the entire book. (I was having some serious doubts that I'd be able to force myself through all of it.) The story itself was interesting. I don't think the author really knew where she was going with the story, it seemed it took half the book for her to decide what she was going to do with the story. The main character was not very well developed. It was really all over the place and you never really could get a feel for \"the real\" character. She seemed to change and shift with the story. It was all very melodramatic. It was pretty obnoxious, actually. There wasn't even a really good description of what the main character looked like. It was the typical \"I'm not popular. I'm so unique.\" set up with no real description of the character, so she could have been any \"outcast\" girl.<br \/><br \/>For Parents: I do not think this is a teen book at all. It contained regular cursing, though probably on a PG-13 level. It contained talk of cutting. (And while it did not condone it, it did not really speak against it. It mainly just put it as a phase of life- the cutting phase.) It also has lots of mentioning of teen sex, underage drinking, and drug use.

{"rating":3,"title":"A Flawed Book","text":"&#34;Don't You Cry&#34; is a psychological mystery narrated by two young persons.  Quinn is a young woman in her early twenties living in Chicago whose roommate has gone missing.  Alex is a teenager whose mother abandoned him when he was only five and whose father is an alcoholic; he works in a diner in Michigan.  The story is narrated in alternate chapters by these two characters, and for most of the book it is impossible to see the connection between them.  Both narrators, for different reasons, are unreliable, and this makes some of their conclusions and judgments erroneous.  The two strands come together at the end of the novel, and mystery fans will like all the twists and turns, all the false clues and misleading observations.<br \/><br \/>I, however, was very frustrated by this book.  It was neither the subject nor the structure that troubled me; indeed, I really like the dual narrator device when it is skillfully done.  What annoyed me repeatedly was the writing, which was not uniformly terrible, but which had frequent moments that gave me pause as a reader.<br \/><br \/>First among these was the author's frequent use of the pathetic fallacy, or the attribution of human emotions to nature.  In one scene, the sea comes on shore, grabbing at the ankles of a person standing near it, inviting her into the deep.  In another, the &#34;deranged November air&#34; dislodges a tin can from a trash barrel.  This sort of thing occurs all too often for my taste.<br \/><br \/>Second is the tone.  I realize that the author is trying to convey the affect of young people, but the tone of both narrators is smart aleck-y and flippant, a &#34;too cool for school&#34; attitude.  Both narrators are irreverent and cynical, and if you were given a chapter without knowing whose point of view it was, you would be justified is guessing either one.  There should be some differences between a college-educated young career woman in the city and a disaffected and somewhat lost adolescent boy, but with respect to tone, there are none.<br \/><br \/>Finally, the author makes frequent use of metaphors that are imprecise and distracting.  For example, when Quinn is trying to find her missing roommate's cell phone by calling her number, she describes it thus:  &#34;I . . . continue to search, tracking the subdued ringtone as Hansel and Gretel tracked bread crumbs through the deep, dark, woods.&#34;  Alex describes the waitresses who use their break time to smoke cigarettes this way:  &#34;. . . the two of them teeter-tottering all day on their rotating smoke breaks.&#34;  Both of these metaphors are ridiculous if you think about them in any depth, and these are only two examples.  I love these use of effective metaphor, but most of the metaphors in this book were ineffective and annoying.  (If you are interested in an author whose metaphors are superb, read Amy Parker's new book, &#34;Beasts and Children.&#34;)<br \/><br \/>So here is my advice for anyone who is considering buying this book.  Read some of the positive reviews, of which there are many on the Amazon site.  It may be that what detracted from my reading of this book would not bother you at all.  Then make your decision.","images":[],"asin":"0778319059","parent_asin":"0778319059","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1462997301000,"helpful_vote":134,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3202,"length_group":3}

Fourth in the &#34;Brit in the FBI&#34; series (the first is [[ASIN:B00C5R7H70 The Final Cut]]), it works fine as a standalone.  However, it's a plodding, run-of-the-mill thriller in which a team of nearly immortal (you-can't-kill-'em-but-maybe-you-can-wing-'em-if-you're-really-lucky) covert FBI operatives save the U.S. Government and the world once again.  Neither the exotic settings (Venice, Rome, the Bermuda Triangle), nor the fantasy elements (the evildoers' ability to control the weather, thanks to notes from Leonardo da Vinci; the evildoers' mad, obsessive quest for the Ark of the Covenant) are sufficient to lift the novel above the ordinary.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, a professional thief (Kitsune aka &#34;the Fox&#34;) delivers to anonymous clients in Venice an artifact (Aaron's rod) that she stole from the military-guarded Topkapi Palace.  Instead of paying<br \/>Kitsune, the clients send death squads after her.  Kitsune enlists the aid of her FBI enemies from prior series novels (the &#34;Covert Eyes&#34; team of Michaela &#34;Mike&#34; Caine and British-raised Nicholas Drummond), by persuading them that a massive Gobi Desert sandstorm--currently burying Beijing and killing thousands--is not a natural weather phenomenon, but is a man-made event.<br \/><br \/>After Mike and Nicholas arrive in Venice, their meeting with Kitsune is thwarted by a shootout in the Piazza di San Marcos that leaves seven bad guys dead and one FBI team member (Lia) seriously wounded.  Eventually Kitsune successfully contacts Mike and Nicholas. With her help and with help from the FBI team's incredibly skilled teenage computer expert (Adam), Mike and Nicholas identify Kitsune's clients as the evil, &#34;identical&#34; Korath twins (Ajax and Cassandra).  They also figure out that the mad twins are seeking the Ark of the Covenant.  Mike and Nicholas and Kitsune head off to beard the twins in the Koraths' castle stronghold near Rome, and kill a bunch more bad guys on their way.  The novel goes on from there, with more killings and close escapes--it's a very long thriller at 512pp--and eventually the team winds up on an island in the Bermuda Triangle.<br \/><br \/>The well-written novel has lots of action scenes, even though it's not really a page-turner.  It's a decent read, as thrillers go, but nothing to shout home about.  I expected much more from an established, popular writer like Coulter.","images":[],"asin":"1501150324","parent_asin":"1501150324","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1486999199000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2526,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"A microcosm of American immigrant and rural Polish shtetl life","text":"I was originally interested in reading \"Remember This Dream\" because my grandmother and great-grandparents immigrated from a small village near Lublin, Poland in 1913 around the same time as one of the novel's protagonists. Sadly, other than a few stories and a copy of their Russian-Polish passports and ship manifests, I have precious little information on my great-grandparents' immigrant experience, and was interested to see how the novel would handle such details as the ocean crossing (squalid doesn't even begin to describe the horrors faced by steerage class passengers).<br \/><br \/>Harold Gershowitz's \"Remember This Dream\" chronicles the lives of two sisters, Dvoyra and Anna, who have grown up in a Polish shtetl. Anna has been living with her in-laws and her three small children waiting for the opportunity to immigrate to America, where she will reunite with her husband. Dvoyra ends up staying in Poland, where she sees the horrors of WWI and WWII unfold firsthand. (For an excellent background on Polish shtetl life between the wars, be sure to watch [[ASIN:B000CRR3J2 Image Before My Eyes - A History of Jewish Life in Poland Before]]).<br \/><br \/>The main thrust of the novel is Anna's hardscrabble new life in America; her reunion with her husband yields an angry, bitter stranger obsessed with making ends meet to the point that he yanks his young daughters out of school and puts them to work in garment sweatshops. Union organizing takes up a hefty portion of the plot, with Anna and her daughters struggling to organize labor unions.<br \/><br \/>Meanwhile, in Poland Dvoyra's daughter Penina becomes involved in the blossoming Zionist movement even as Anna's daughter Rachel marries the head of the CGWA union. Following a half-century of American and European history, \"Remember This Dream\" serves as a microcosm of the political turmoil and pogroms of Eastern Europe and growing anti-Semitism that eventually culminated in the infamous concentration camps such as Auschwitz. From an American perspective, we see the gradual shedding of immigrant culture (particularly rebellion against shtetl culture) and Old World traditions. For an excellent celluloid take on this phenomenon, [[ASIN:B00065GVIE Hester Street]] features a Jewish shtetl immigrant desperate to shed his Old World image in order to prosper in the New, and is mortally embarrassed by his Old World wife when she arrives.  The third part of the novel focuses on the Jewish ghettos and concentration camp experience.  The ending was shocking in its intensity, muted only by the short epilogue that weaves together the final strands of Anna and Dvoyra's stories.<br \/><br \/>As I am only an amateur scholar of Yiddishkeit, I can't comment on the authenticity of Jewish ceremonies mentioned in the book, but I also picked up on the \"blowing out of the Shabbos candles.\" Shabbos candles must be lit before sundown and may not be extinguished until they burn out naturally. It seemed that Anna's family is an accelerated version of the \"melting pot\" experience, and has shed their Old World religious and cultural customs in a single generation (including Anna) rather than across generations.<br \/><br \/>As other reviewers have commented, there are several extremely implausible scenarios and the intertwining stories skipped ahead at times, leaving me momentarily confused as I had to backtrack. This is a work of fiction, and as such takes liberties (take with a grain of kosher salt), but overall paints a vivid picture of the early-to-mid-20th century, of the struggles faced by recent immigrants, and the love of one family in the face of war's brutalities.","images":[],"asin":"1439203032","parent_asin":"1439203032","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1228539191000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3647,"length_group":3}

For me, I'll probably stick with US investments, especially when so many already do business in China, and probably the biggest takeaway from the book is to be extra cautious about any economic data released from China and make sure I do look for reliable analysts of China's economy.","images":[],"asin":"0132620197","parent_asin":"0132620197","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1316360854000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1321,"length_group":3}

Book construction is high quality as well. But I was taken a little back by the words.  Apparently Aliens speak much like Tonto or Tarzan, dropping  articles like \"a\" and \"the.\" Not so good for a kid who is forming speech.<br \/><br \/>I originally got this for my three-year-old, but it did not hold his attention.  We tried reading it together twice but never got to reach the Big Fun the book was building up to before he ran off.

{"rating":3,"title":"Wealth With Minimal Labor","text":"The 4- Hour Workweek is an interesting book written by a young and interesting guy by the name of Timothy Ferriss. Mr. Ferriss is one of the proclaimed \"New Rich\" that this book is written about. He has experienced the \"too much work for too little pay\" lifestyle and he wrote this book as a means to an end; the end being the liberation of every person who reads the book from the dregs of an eight to five existence.<br \/><br \/>I am a naturally skeptical person and I am often highly critical of books that lead readers to believe they can become rich very quickly and with little effort. But something about this book caught my attention. I don't know if it was the title or what, but I felt a strong urge to read this book. What I discovered with The 4- Hour Workweek was somewhat refreshing. This book doesn't bog the reader down with statistics; doesn't promise to end the cycle of poverty overnight; and doesn't claim to offer a single path to riches. What Ferriss teaches in this book isn't like other books about getting rich. It is more original than most, with an emphasis on finding ways to make a great living automatically: Sitting back and letting the internet, or some other tool, or other people, do the work that needs to be done while you, the latest member of the New Rich, reap the rewards.<br \/><br \/>Certain themes rise to the surface throughout this book and some of the important ones are the conservation of free time; the use of outsourcing and\/or automated income; the importance of recreation; and the various unconventional ways to gain control over one's life. Ferriss is in favor of eliminating anything from your life that robs you of your most precious asset: your time. He feels the way to accomplish this is by seeking out opportunities that offer substantial rewards for the least effort and he believes with complete sincerity that there are ways that everyone can work less and make more.<br \/><br \/>Finding ways to get the cash flowing without devoting endless hours of time is a great idea, but I still have a few problems with the advice in this book. For starters, Ferriss makes the process seem a little too easy and he keeps holding himself up as an example that anyone else can do exactly what he did. One of the things he talks about in the opening section is that he was a national champion in Chinese Kickboxing. He talks about this accomplishment and his methodology for achieving it, making it seem like this is something anyone else with enough determination could have done. I have to disagree with him on this point. I think it's safe to say that the majority of the people in the world would not have the guts to do something like this, no matter how strong their will might be. And what about those of us with families? I don't think most spouses would be willing to jump up and move about the world with children in tow. Because it worked for him doesn't necessarily mean it will work for everyone.<br \/><br \/>Some of the book's other bits of advice is equally shaky, like the recommendation to employees to talk to their bosses and negotiate working from home instead of from the office. The author claims this is easier than you might first think, but I beg to differ. I have worked in many different businesses and, more often than not, a request to work from home would be met by a supervisor either with laughter or with a counter request to go home and not come back. If someone really wants to work from home and escape the eight to five life, entrepreneurship is really the only solution. To Ferriss' credit, he does spend a good deal of time talking about how to start and run your own company but I feel he should have gone directly to this and bypassed the idea of keeping your current job and working out of the home.<br \/><br \/>Overall, the 4- Hour Workweek is an interesting book with a catchy title and an unorthodox approach to making money. Ferriss deserves credit for formulating his methods in original ways and for avoiding the tendency to push this as a get rich quick scheme, but he also deserves a small amount of criticism for making his plan sound so simple that anyone can do it and for his insistence that anyone can be anything with the right attitude. Life and financial overachievement are not quite that simple, but I applaud Ferriss for approaching this age- old issue from a fresh perspective.","images":[],"asin":"0307353133","parent_asin":"0307353133","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1194957153000,"helpful_vote":21,"verified_purchase":true,"length":4383,"length_group":3}

The two are caught up in a whirlwind romance and various supernatural threats; in Eclipse, the vampire stalker Victoria is after Bella and has created an army of young vampires who are terrorizing Seattle. Bella floats through her senior year waiting for graduation, when Edward will turn her into a vampire so that they can be together forever.<br \/><br \/>The first novel [[ASIN:0316015849 Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)]] and parts of [[ASIN:0316160199 New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2)]] were based around Romeo and Juliet; Bella's inspiration in Eclipse is Wuthering Heights, which goes to show the unhealthy relationships she fosters with both Edward and young werewolf Jake.<br \/><br \/>In the first novel, Bella used Jake to gain access to information about Edward and his vampire \"family.\" Jake had a puppy-dog reaction to Bella's attention in Twilight, but when he transformed into a werewolf, he becomes a sneering, possessive, violent contender for Bella's heart, brutally kissing her and making lewd suggestions. Edward demands that he and Bella be married before he brings her across, and Bella pouts and fights it like a five-year-old. Instead of being excited about the prospect of a wedding, she votes for a drive-through wedding in Vegas, although Edward's sister Alice ends up being her wedding planner.<br \/><br \/>The tribal legends were interesting, but not enough to save the lackluster plot. Bella and Edward aren't even directly involved in the final battle (talk about anticlimactic), and the plot was fairly evident from the beginning. The Cullens, portrayed as \"good\" vampires in earlier books, are witness to an act of brutality, yet make no audible comment about the poor girl involved.<br \/><br \/>I quickly grew tired of Edward and Bella's predictable reactions about what horrible people they are, etc., Bella's extended tantrums and crying fits, and Jake's desire to bed Bella (or at least convince her that he's her perfect mate).

{"rating":3,"title":"Delightful Aunty Lee's Second Investigation Is Entertaining, But Not a Standalone","text":"AUNTY LEE'S DEADLY SPECIALS is entertaining and fun if you've already read the first \"Aunty Lee\" ([[ASIN:0062227157 Aunty Lee's Delights]]), but it's not really a standalone.  And it's not nearly as well-written as the first book.  It seems hastily thrown together, as if to meet a publisher's deadline.  This second book lacks the charm, careful writing, and precise plotting of the earlier book, although Aunty Lee herself remains the same--a delightful  force to be reckoned with.  \"Commissioner Raja caught her eye but said nothing.  Stopping Aunty Lee was like trying to stop ice melting . . . It's going to happen anyway, you just try to put the bucket in the right place.\"<br \/><br \/>In AUNTY LEE'S DEADLY SPECIALS, a big-time lawyer (Mabel Sung) hires Aunty Lee to cater a brunch in celebration of daughter Sharon Sung's elevation to full partner in Mabel's famous law firm, Sung Law.  On the menu--at the client's request--is a traditional chicken dish that incorporates black nuts containing cyanide.  The dish is poisonous unless all the cyanide is properly removed, and of course Aunty Lee knows how to prepare it right.  But naturally the worst happens:  Mabel and her generally disliked son Leonard die after eating Aunty Lee's chicken, and Aunty Lee's food shop is closed down while the police investigate their untimely deaths that look suspiciously like murders.<br \/><br \/>Aunty Lee investigates along with the police (Commissioner Raja, Inspector Salim), and with some help from her illegal foreign \"maid\" (Nina), and her new \"drinks business\" partner (Cherril Peters).  Aunty Lee's inquiries are also helped along by her extensive contacts among Singapore's well-established elite families, and by her married gay friends (Otto and Joe).  All of these are carryovers from the first book.  The inquiries eventually involve Aunty Lee with a prayer group that seems to be arranging organ transplants for its members!<br \/><br \/>The first Aunty Lee book, [[ASIN:0062227157 Aunty Lee's Delights]], sets out many important facts about Aunty Lee that are buried or altogether missing from this sequel.  To mention a few:  Aunty Lee cooks superb Peranakan food (a special kind of Singaporean cuisine); her bottled delicacies are well-known and admired in Singapore; she's an indefatigable busybody; and she cooks for her friends and family in order to manage them all to her own best benefit.<br \/><br \/>Because so much of what makes Aunty Lee a memorable character is missing from AUNTY LEE'S DEADLY SPECIALS, and because this book seems so hastily written, I rate it at 3 stars (\"It's okay\" on the official Amazon scale).  As an Aunty Lee fan, I enjoyed the mystery--and I don't want to miss the next Aunty Lee book.  However, if this were my first and only Aunty Lee book, I wouldn't be wanting to read another.","images":[],"asin":"0062338323","parent_asin":"0062338323","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1409097122000,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2826,"length_group":3}

There's an inherent problem when your main character is a villain. While Star Wars has oft celebrated the &#34;bad guys&#34; and Darth Maul's unceremonious introduction and death in Ep I makes you wonder if he really was a bad ass after all, this book seeks to give him some legend in the world of hand to hand combat. Pitting him against various creatures from the universe, the only way to keep him the protagonist is to make everyone around him even worse than he is. There is no showdown between Maul and some villain worse than he is. Just criminals and scum and since you know he won't die, there's no real mystery. If you've read other Star Wars books, the outcome is predictable. A few inconsistencies with what appears to be cannon but the book is otherwise unremarkable.

{"rating":3,"title":"Small Town Kid Achieves His Dream","text":"Mickey Mantle is legendary in the world of sports and he holds many World Series records as well as records for hitting some of the longest home runs. But his initiation into the world of major League Baseball was not without its struggles and this book highlights the many highs and lows of Mantle's first season with the New York Yankees.<br \/><br \/>Mantle was very young when he began his Major League baseball career and his youth and inexperience led to some struggles at the plate. He was sent back to the minor leagues at one point, mainly due to his tendency to strike out. He had awesome power and was very speedy on the bases. But his tendency to swing the bat hard and fast at most pitches, with the goal of hitting another homer, led to his excessively large number of strikeouts. He was very disappointed in himself, but he worked hard in the minors and was given a second chance. Mantle gives his father part of the credit for convincing him to continue working hard and striving to reach his goal of playing in the major leagues.<br \/><br \/>Rookie in Pinstripes captures these and other important moments in Mantle's young career and the book helps illustrate how Mantle was feeling at different times throughout his rookie season; including his frustrations with his performance, his love interest with future wife Merlyn, his acclimation to the Yankees and life in a big city, etc. Mickey Mantle was a shy, somewhat backward kid from rural Oklahoma who had no previous exposure to big city culture. He was quite awkward when he arrived in New York City. Only through experience did the naïve Mantle eventually adapt to his new lifestyle and his newfound fame.<br \/><br \/>Rookie in Pinstripes covers only Mickey Mantle's rookie season. It offers a little bit of biographical information about Mantle so that the reader will have a better understanding about his lifestyle and the many opportunities and challenges it presented. But the majority of the book is spent talking about the rookie season with the Yankees, Mantle's struggles at the plate, his interaction with other players, his relationship with Yankee's manager Casey Stengel, etc. There is also some play- by- play action when the book is talking about some of the more important Yankee games during the 1951 season, as well as the starting lineups for the teams and other important statistics. This play-by- play is brief, but it gets the reader in the right frame of mind. You will feel like you are right there, watching the game.<br \/><br \/>Rookie in Pinstripes is a pretty good book, but it does have a few faults. The most glaring of all is the book's short length. I realize this book is only intended to cover Mantle's rookie season, and thus it cannot be expected to be extremely lengthy. But some more research and additional chapters would have made this book much more memorable. I also didn't like the book's ending. Suddenly, Mantle learns about the death of his father. He is naturally heartbroken, but the book just ends right there. At the very least, a concluding chapter would have been nice to wrap things up in a proper way.<br \/><br \/>Overall, however, Rookie in Pinstripes is still a good book for baseball fans of all ages. Mickey Mantle is a giant in the world of Major League Baseball and he has set many World Series records that are not likely to be broken. His rookie season was marked by personal issues, professional problems and, ultimately, triumph in his chosen sport. Yankee fans will love this book most, but casual fans of Major League Baseball will also find some interesting moments in Rookie in Pinstripes. It is a good book about one of baseball's most successful big league players.","images":[],"asin":"0595709362","parent_asin":"0595709362","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1218211386000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3703,"length_group":3}

To write the book, Dundas set out on a personal expedition to discover all there is to know about the great fictional detective.  Now he takes his readers along with him on that entertaining journey, and shares all that he found out.  His flippant prose is replete with little-known facts: facts about the birth of the detective story; Arthur Conan Doyle's early, poorly compensated efforts as a hack short story writer; the number of replicas of Holmes' rooms at 221B Baker Street in existence around the world; and many, many more.<br \/><br \/>In theory, the book is a work of literary criticism (because it analyzes the &#34;essential&#34; Sherlock Holmes stories, and is the product of genuine research, if not exactly rising to the level of serious scholarship), but it reads more like a memoir (because it spends so much time on Dundas' boyhood discovery of Holmes' adventures, and on descriptions of where and how he found his facts, and employs such a casual, serendipitous sort of organization).  For serious Sherlock Holmes fans, this book is probably immensely entertaining.  For more casual Sherlock Holmes fans (like myself), it's a decent summer read.

{"rating":3,"title":"How Significant is the Immigration Issue?","text":"State of Emergency was written by television commentator, political speech writer, and political analyst Patrick Buchanan as a warning. This book isn't warning about pending terrorist attacks, an earth depleted of natural resources, or coming natural disasters. No, this book wars about something its author considers a far greater danger than any of those things: The slow but certain takeover of America by foreign people. Pat Buchanan feels that this constant influx of foreigners is going to overwhelm the United States in a very short time. He also worries that these foreign people are not becoming assimilated the way they should, and are thus still tied to their foreign cultures; making them less American than they should be and more likely to bring an end to America as we know it.<br \/><br \/>State of Emergency is basically a book about the direct problem of immigration and it points out many facts that should make us all wary of allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the country. One is the problem with illegal aliens and the likely expansion of the welfare state. This book raises a legitimate concern in this area, and I can understand why the author feels the ways he does about illegal immigrants and the impact they have on the nation's finances. Since the majority of these immigrants arrive from third world countries, they lack the education and sophistication to compete with ordinary Americans. But at the same time, American law protects children of the poor by offering them an education regardless of parent's financial status. This means that immigrants, generally speaking, are going to consume more services that they pay for in taxes. It will be up to the other members of society to foot the bill, and this will likely lead to a huge financial strain on the citizens of the land. This makes sense and it is one part of the book that anyone will agree with.<br \/><br \/>Another area where the book states the plain truth is with politicians. Buchanan is disgusted with Republican politicians who have decided to go soft on the immigration issue and grant amnesty to all illegals living in the U.S. Buchanan feels this is a betrayal of conservative principles and it shows that Republicans are willing to throw away any semblance of a principled political party if doing so would lead to lost elections. He is disgusted with George W. Bush more than anyone. But he also points out other Republicans and even some Democrats who are in favor of what the president has proposed doing with illegal immigrants. Whether you agree or not with the author's anger, there is truth to what he says in this regard.<br \/><br \/>I like that Buchanan was willing to tackle an important issue like this in print form. Buchanan stresses many key concerns- some of which I had not thought about before and now have considered as possible reasons to support sharp limitations in immigration. However, the book also points out key points that I disagree with, like building a fence along the border between the United States and Mexico or the philosophical idea that diversity does not lead to national strength. Given the reputation of the United States as a beacon of freedom for people all over the world, I don't see how building a fence is going to improve or even sustain that image. A physical fence seems like too much, even though Buchanan does argue for this and other key points quite effectively. And what about deporting individuals back to Mexico? Is this really the answer to America's immigration woes? How could this be accomplished without causing even greater problems?<br \/><br \/>Pat Buchanan doesn't want readers to simply take his word for it, so he offers many different statistical measurements to back his claims. This is smart because it shows that the concerns addressed in the books are not just the ranting of a paranoid senior citizen. They are very real, and there are plenty of statistics that prove the assertion that immigrants really are growing in number by leaps and bounds.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I found State of Emergency a pretty good book overall about the subject of immigration. I usually disagree with Pat Buchanan's political positions because they are often a little too extreme and they advocate too large an increase in government control over the people. I also feel that this book, with its fear- mongering and general pessimism, is a little bit on the alarmist side. But I can also see where Buchanan is coming from and his persuasive abilities are enough to give this book a three- star rating and a recommendation. I don't agree with everything it says, but it offers many important concerns about the issue of immigration with plenty of stats to prove that its concerns are valid.","images":[],"asin":"0312360037","parent_asin":"0312360037","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1192134420000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":true,"length":4743,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Challenging and slow to start","text":"\"An Uncommon Education\" by Elizabeth Percer traces the life of Naomi Feinstein from early childhood through her college years at Wellesley and, briefly, beyond.  Though there were moments of lovely writing and insight, I found much of this book a tough go.<br \/><br \/>The reader can look at other reviews for a summary.  I will try here to describe the strengths and weaknesses of the book.  First, some of the writing is excellent.  The book is slow-moving, especially in the first half, and much of the writing describes the thoughts of a sensitive, intelligent child dealing with a loving but depressed home life and the pain of being the odd man out at school.  Naomi's insights are beyond her years, and her struggle to make even one friend is well-documented.  The pace of the book picks up when Naomi finally goes to Wellesley, fulfilling her father's dream for her (and, she thinks, her own dream).  At Wellesley, surrounded by other highly intelligent and driven women, she begins to find her true path.  The second half of the book is much more satisfying than the first, much better paced and far less ruminative.  Naomi's friendship with a Japanese economics student, Jun Oko, is central to her becoming the person she is meant to be.<br \/><br \/>But there are other aspects that are problematic, at least for me.  First, the book begins with a long treatise on Naomi's father's near obsession with Rose Kennedy (and Naomi's fascination with Rose's daughter Rosemary, who was lobotomized in her early 20s and never recovered).  It is Rose, however, who is the father's real obsession, especially with respect to her frustrated desire to attend Wellesley, which was sacrificed to her father's political ambitions.  He  thinks of all Rose could have been with a Wellesley education, and Naomi is encouraged even at age six to aim for Wellesley.  The first scene in the book has Naomi as a child getting sick at the Kennedy house in Brookline, Massachusetts.  This entire theme recurs again and again, and I found it annoying, repetitive, and pointless.<br \/><br \/>I expected to love this book.  I enjoy coming-of-age stories, and I loved Curtis Sittenfeld's \"Prep\" and the film version of \"Dead Poets Society,\"  and when I read the advance information that this book would appeal to fans of these works, I enthusiastically ordered it.  I have to say, however, that it was a disappointment.  I wondered at times if it were more memoir than novel, and I think it would have worked better as memoir.  Most readers will be put off, I think, by long passages describing every thought and every nuance of every thought.<br \/><br \/>I hate to be so critical of a author's work, especially a first novel.  I know how hard it is to write, and I think this author has great promise.  I wonder if, years from now, this book will be re-issued as a \"first novel\" by a great writer whose later work is far superior.  I can see that happening, and I hope it does.","images":[],"asin":"0062110969","parent_asin":"0062110969","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1331995672000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2956,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Missing Some Necessary Details","text":"I’m a long way off from retirement but I am already thinking about what I want to do when I no longer participate in the work force. I selected this book as more of an idea book and a starting point, to get some idea of what I might want to do later. This book is stuffed full of ideas but there are some oversights that I think merit mention and could use a revisit.<br \/><br \/>The book boasts 150 ideas for trips and activities to do when retired. There are some simple and easy ones in there, such as hiking domestic trails or getting iconic meals in different areas of the country. A good number of them, though, require international travel and a good deal of money. There are a lot of ideas that are simply out of reach for the average retiree. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though it should be more clear.<br \/><br \/>Where this book does drop the ball is in the lack of necessary details. For example, on page 41 the title of the adventure is “Learn North African Cooking in Marrakech”. It presents the idea and gives all of the positive points, such as what you’ll be doing, what you’ll learn and so on. What it does not tell you is what travel preps are needed – like a passport, travel visa and immunizations – and it gives no clue how much this trip might cost. It avoids mention of any possible travel restrictions, potential hazards and more. This is true on all international suggestions, not just this one. In fact, even the domestic journeys lack much detail in that regard.<br \/><br \/>This is an idea book more than anything, though it is lacking in important details such that it is of diminished usefulness. This is particularly true of any suggestions that would take the reader abroad. There are some fine domestic ideas, though, so all is not lost.","images":[],"asin":"1685396380","parent_asin":"1685396380","user_id":"AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ","timestamp":1675823706487,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1776,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Three Holiday Stories","text":"This book has 3 holiday romance stories. I really didn't care for any of the stories. The first one, by Diana Palmer was my favorite of the three, and I thought it was just okay. It was very quick paced, but there was a lot of religious stuff and conservative politics which I could have done without. I also found Dal, the male romantic lead to be a jerk, without any redeemable qualities. He has a quick change of heart in the end of the story that seems unnatural and rushed. There were some lose ends that got addressed in the last two pages of the story which should have had more attention given to them, especially the one involving Meadow's medical results. The second story by Lindsay McKenna involves former military heroes and PTSD. I've read one of her Wind River Ranch romances before and enjoyed it. This story was a bit flat and repetitive. Kassie, the heroine of the story was overly sweet and just boring. The final story by Margaret Way was my least favorite. I was most excited about it because it was described as a Australian Outback Cowboy Romance. It was more like a ridiculous soap opera\/fairy tale with an evil step mother (okay an evil aunt in the story). A young woman and her husband get divorced because of trouble caused by the aunt. Two years later they face one another and deal with what happened. It just wasn't realistic in my opinion. In all three stories, the women were weak and passive and I didn't like any of them.","images":[],"asin":"1420144693","parent_asin":"1420144693","user_id":"AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A","timestamp":1506648758571,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1455,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Lincoln Is Mostly Absent; Historical Setting, Characters Don't Come to Life","text":"THESE HONORED DEAD:  A LINCOLN AND SPEED MYSTERY is loosely based on historical fact--accounts of Lincoln's early Illinois trials, and of his close friendship with a Springfield general store manager, Joshua Fry Speed.  However, Fry is the viewpoint character, and the events are imaginary, so the &quot;Lincoln&quot; part of the subtitle is misleading, in that Lincoln barely contributes to the murder mystery investigation.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, a young woman is murdered (stabbed to death) in a town close to Springfield (Menard), and her body is discovered by her aunt (the Widow Harriman).  Fry and the Widow are paramours.  When the Widow becomes the chief suspect in the police investigation, Fry launches his own investigation to clear the Widow's name.  More murders follow.<br \/><br \/>Fry's sister joins him in Springfield (having travelled from the family home in Kentucky).  Fry spends a lot of time riding his horse (Hickory) between Springfield and Menard.  Lincoln offers advice to the Widow, who declines his legal services.  A former Harvard German-language tutor, and the keeper of an early form of insane asylum, also figure in the plot.<br \/><br \/>The book is well written, and the plot has unexpected twists and turns, but it's rather boring as a mystery story.  As historical fiction, the book fails to bring the historical setting and characters to life.  Lincoln is mostly absent, and Fry comes across as a rather naive, immature young man.  For these reasons, I rate THESE HONORED DEAD at 3 stars (&quot;It's okay&quot; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1629537772","parent_asin":"1629537772","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1472052438000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1578,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"A Tale of Two Irresponsible Dog Owners","text":"My kids thought the book was cute. They enjoyed the superficial feel goodness of the story.<br \/><br \/>I, on the other hand, wasn't impressed. Essentially, a family decides to take their family dog to the animal shelter because the dog was annoying and they felt another dog would be better suited for their family. Now, in a very non-realistic turn of events (because let's face it, the realistic outcome would have been that the family pet would have been put to sleep) the family picks a new dog and their dog is chosen by the family of the new dog (who also took their dog to the animal shelter to trade it out for something better). Now, animal shelters are not dog trading businesses. The new dog is depressed, which the parents love because who doesn't want a dog that just lays around all day? The kids don't like the new dog because it doesn't \"do\" anything. So, they end up getting together with the old dog owners, who now own their old dog, and they end up trading dogs because the dogs they had to begin with were best for their family. Unrealistic happy ending, but whatever. The parents are hard noses in the beginning, then push overs in the end. (Isn't that the way children't stories seem to work?) The dog that was so unbearably annoying that the family would risk it being euthanized ended up being the beloved member of the family.","images":[],"asin":"0761451617","parent_asin":"0761451617","user_id":"AEICZD35OTDYVWA2KPYWN4PDZ2SA","timestamp":1363902035000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1352,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"If Dali painted murder mysteries...","text":"They'd probably turn out like this. \"The Vampire of Venice Beach\" was my first brush with the McAfee twins, private investigators who are drawn into some truly bizarre cases. Hired to work security for the opening of a goth \/ vampire art gallery where the main attraction is Ephemera, the former high school homecoming queen turned Queen of the Undead, the twins have their hands full when the Queen of the Undead winds up dead.<br \/><br \/>Their investigation descends deep into the underbelly of the \"social vampire\" movement (including fang caps and mutual blood drinking), and gets weirder from there: there's a subplot involving a conspiracy and a famous film starlet, a murderous failed football pro, domestic abuse, dead bodies turning up alive (and previously alive bodies turning up dead)...<br \/><br \/>Romantic tension comes in the form of Kerry's love triangle with two cops: FBI Agent Franzen, and Detective Boatwright. Oh, and did I mention that her evil twin Terry is a (formerly) coke-snorting lesbian who drives a shockingly pink Harley? Generally, the twins are busy chasing down leads, being assaulted by nocturnal vampires bearing laughing gas canisters, and tracking down suspects.<br \/><br \/>As a fan of the Canadian series [[ASIN:B0000C23T1 Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)]] and Blood Ties, the vampire subplot will appeal to goths and vamps, although the bloodletting may put off more sensitive readers.

{"rating":3,"title":"Decent specific guide but leaves out too much territory ...","text":"If you're interested only in the east side of south Florida, the Everglades, and the Keys, this book will work nicely for you. But if you're interested in the WEST side of south Florida, you'll be disappointed.<br \/><br \/>I got this specifically because I'll be visiting Florida in October of next year at the end of a Panama Canal cruise that docks in Miami. My plan is to take 7-10 days exploring south Florida by rental car, and then fly home to the Pacific NW.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, I'll definitely need another guide to check out Naples, Marco Island, Fort Myers, Sanibel Island -- basically, anything on the Gulf side of the southern part of Florida, since these aren't covered at all other than brief references to things like catching a ferry to the Keys or a place to eat if you're visiting the Everglades.<br \/><br \/>The good news is that Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Boca Raton, Palm Beach, the Keys, and the Everglades are nicely covered with a lot of good current info. I've been to Miami several times, so I'm already somewhat familiar with that area, but I'm definitely looking forward to visiting the Keys as well as the Everglades. Lots of good guidance, including some recommendations for &#34;off the beaten path&#34; attractions.<br \/><br \/>You'll also need to get a good map. The only maps provided in the book are for Miami city and Orlando -- which is in the north part of the state, not the focus of this guide. I really don't understand including it at all!<br \/><br \/>Others have mentioned the printing, and I, too, found it difficult to read. My plan now is to use this along with at least one or two other guides plus various websites to plan my road trip itinerary and take notes, then leave the book home.<br \/><br \/>If your need for a guide to south Florida is very specific to just the few south Florida places that are covered here, and your eyesight is much better than mine, you will probably find this book a reasonable source of info. But the lack of a good comprehensive map and its lack of coverage of the west side of south Florida makes it probably not the best choice.

{"rating":3,"title":"“Lucky Peach” a good (if basic) guide to Asian (and Asian-inspired) cuisine","text":"I’m fairly new to the “Lucky Peach” magazine (I recently used the LP article “The Meaning of Mangoes” with my advanced ESL students) and just spent six months working (and cooking \/ eating my way across) Taiwan, so I was thrilled to see that Lucky Peach had a cookbook coming out. “Lucky Peach Presents 101 Easy Asian Recipes” is true to its title; beginning with a genius illustrated guide to the Asian pantry (presented in basic, intermediate, and champion levels), this book will help you take baby steps to becoming proficient with Asian tools, ingredients and cooking methods. Do note that if you are even passingly familiar with basic cooking techniques and Asian cooking in general, this book is likely a little simpler than you are looking for, but it would be great for college students and those new to the kitchen.<br \/><br \/>The book is based on two main rules: no frying, and no subrecipes.<br \/><br \/>Beginning with cold dishes, appetizers and “pickly bits,” you’ll find classics like garlic-smashed cucumbers, seaweed salad, soy sauce eggs, green papaya salad, and dumplings. I was a little surprised not to see the ubiquitous Taiwanese tea eggs make an appearance. I was also hoping for a chapter of standalone egg dishes like chawanmushi (steamed egg custard also found in Taiwan) as I am a firm believer in breakfast for dinner, but there are several substantial egg dishes throughout the book (omurice, dashiaki tamago, egg foo young).<br \/><br \/>Pancakes include Japanese okonomiyaki, Taiwan \/ China contributes scallion pancakes (my favorite Taiwanese snack hands-down!), and there are several Korean pancakes in addition to moo shu pancakes and vegetables. Soups and stews offer some rather surprising combinations like miso clam chowder and rotisserie chicken ramen; you’ll also find a slow-cooker pho, vegetarian hot pot and Massaman curry.<br \/><br \/>Noodles include soba, jap chae, pad see ew, pesto ramen, and spicy mushroom ragu. Having lived in Japan and Taiwan and having sampled numerous excellent noodle dishes in both, I was honestly expecting more from the noodle chapter. Where is udon? Cold sesame noodles? Many types of noodles are covered in the discussion in ingredients, but not used in later chapters.<br \/><br \/>I was more enthused about the rice dishes; ume and kabocha rice, onigiri, omurice and sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves are all dishes I can see myself making frequently. I was surprised that there weren’t more Taiwanese \/ Thai-style fried rice recipes, although there is a basic &#34;build your own&#34; guide to adding sauce and extras. Vegetarians will delight in the simple yet tasty veggie options, including miso-glazed eggplant (one of my favorite ways to prepare it), stir-fried asparagus, bok choy with oyster sauce (you can find vegetarian oyster sauce in larger Asian supermarkets), dry-fried green beans, roasted squash with red glaze, and roasted sweet potatoes.<br \/><br \/>The book really shines in its treatment of poultry and meat dishes; I felt it was much more successful than the noodle dishes. You’ll find twelve chicken recipes ranging from Japanese (oyakodon), Filipino (chicken adobo), Korean, and Chinese (five-spice, lacquered, Hainan Chicken rice, Chinese chicken salad).<br \/><br \/>The dressings and sauces chapter was very handy; I love the carrot-ginger dressing, two ginger scallion sauces, tofu dressing, and the odd flavor sauce. Curiously, the desserts chapter only offered two recipes: oranges, and egg custard tarts. Yes, I get that in traditional Chinese culture, “dessert” may consist of fruit (in Taiwan, if you are visiting someone’s home, fruit is always brought as a gift). However, seeing the heavy Thai \/ Vietnamese \/ Japanese influence in other chapters, I’m surprised that more Asian sweets weren’t included (mangoes with sticky rice, green tea infused desserts, etc.). Several chapters suffered from similar brevity; the breakfast chapter only includes four recipes (again, I was surprised not to see congee here as it can be made in a rice cooker). It also took some getting used to that the notes came after the recipes.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a good first cookbook if you are new to Asian cuisine; the illustrated pantry guide is immensely helpful if you are new to these ingredients and trying to locate them in an Asian supermarket. It’s also very handy for quick pickles, basic dumplings (using premade wrappers), etc. Illustrations for slightly trickier dishes like dashimaki tamago and dumplings are very helpful. However, I felt like it could have had so much more potential given the huge range of variety and influences in Asian cuisine.<br \/><br \/>(I received this book through Blogging for Books)","images":[],"asin":"0804187797","parent_asin":"0804187797","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1447334028000,"helpful_vote":47,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4716,"length_group":3}

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.

{"rating":3,"title":"Good Materials, Bad Format","text":"I selected this book because it looked like it might be a helpful resource in our work environment, where prototyping is not in as widespread use as it could and probably should be. Building a prototype is a good proof-of-concept first step, and sometimes knowing where to start is enough to motivate a team to building a workable solution. This book does what it is supposed to do. That said, I dislike the format and the book has a feel of being more like a webpage set to print instead of a published book.<br \/><br \/>There is a logical ordering to the material that makes sense. There are eight chapters in this book: “Defining the Case for Prototyping”, “The Prototyping Process”, “An Overview of Prototyping Tools and Techniques”, “Paper Prototyping”, “Creating Clickable Prototypes from Designs”, “Integrated Tools for Drawing and Creating Prototypes”, “Building HTML Prototypes”, and “Using Prototypes in Your Project Workflow”. These do cover the material well, but they are also fairly concise and to the point which is refreshing when compared to books that ramble on for 300+ pages and have double the words to say the same things.<br \/><br \/>The book uses examples and use cases to make its points. It uses a lot of images and pictures.<br \/><br \/>This little book goes into details about several prototyping tools and explains how to use them. If the issue is getting started with a particular tool, this is a good starting place to get you off the ground and working.<br \/><br \/>My whole issue with this book is not the material. It is the format. It has the feel of being a web page that was printed on non-photo paper then bound for distribution. Instead of feeling like a book (and a somewhat expensive one), it feels more like an internal report intended for a presentation. This format does not work for me and unfortunately I can’t get past it, especially at the asking price.

{"rating":3,"title":"Impossibly Cluttered Plot; Highly Disorganized Female Investigator","text":"MURDER IN SAINT-GERMAIN is my first “Aimee Leduc” novel, and I suspect that it's NOT among the best in this long-running series. (It's the 17th “Aimee Leduc Investigation”; the first is [[ASIN:1616957301 Murder in the Marais]].)  Aimee comes across as a dismayingly disorganized private investigator (surely she's not just inept)--her transportation is an unreliable scooter, she can't ever reach her business partner when she needs to, she takes on complex new assignments when she's already strapped for time, and she's constantly scrambling to find trustworthy caregivers for her infant daughter (Chloe).<br \/><br \/>In the novel, Aimee runs two concurrent extra investigations atop her contracted computer systems security work at the prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts.  The first investigation begins as simple scanning of the art school’s emails on behalf of a famous professor (Jules Dechard); it eventually uncovers clandestine sexual liaisons and blackmail threats that threaten the school’s very existence.  The second investigation requires locating a presumed-dead Bosnian warlord who may or may not still exist; the warlord or someone else may be plotting to murder Aimee’s extremely busy counterterrorism investigator friend (Suzanne).<br \/><br \/>Does the plot sound complicated?  You bet it is.  Plus Aimee herself becomes a murder suspect, gets imprisoned, constantly fends off colleague’s entreaties to visit her dying former mentor (Morbier), and tries to handle her former husband's suspicious insistence on babysitting Chloe.<br \/><br \/>The investigations are resolved by novel’s end, but the story nevertheless ends with a significant cliffhanger involving Aimee’s back story.  This was annoying, even for someone like myself who was ignorant of the back story.  The Paris setting is described with considerable detail, and is probably accurate.  However, I found the plot to be impossibly cluttered, and I never could warm to Aimee (who carries wigs and other silly disguises around for use at a moment’s notice).<br \/><br \/>Series fans will of course want to read this book for the information about Aimee's ongoing personal and work relationships.","images":[],"asin":"1616957700","parent_asin":"1616957700","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1495896683000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2169,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"A lot of in info in a pamphlet","text":"On my first pass through this book I concluded that it was filled with inaccurate information and was not a book that I'd recommend. However, after thinking about it and rereading it I came to the firm conclusion that this is one of the most valuable resources available to the new technical support professional.<br \/><br \/>Why the 180 degree change in opinion? There are two major reasons - (1) it covers the essentials, such as tiered support, escalation and service level management, and (2) it gives excellent advice about setting user expectations. In fact, it ties these two key elements together in a coherent manner.<br \/><br \/>What I did not like (at first) was some of the definitions, such as support tiers, that the author provided. I realized that unless one is well versed in the ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) and iSMF (International Service Management Forum) approaches (both of which are collaborative and completely aligned to one another), definitions are not as relevant as the principles - and the principles are the most difficult to grasp. To that end this book shines because it is an easy read and demystifies some of the more complex principles of technical support, and does so with clear writing.<br \/><br \/>If you are new to technical support I recommend that you read this book first before tackling some of the more detailed books on the subject, such as \"IT Problem Management\" by Gary S. Walker and Harris Kern (ISBN 013030770X) or \"IT Service Management: An Introduction\" Jan Van Bon (ISBN 9080671347), both of which will build upon the foundation laid in this book.","images":[],"asin":"0595225748","parent_asin":"0595225748","user_id":"AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ","timestamp":1038513405000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1603,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"A fact book on adventurous women from history","text":"For the first 50 pages or so, the author, talks about different ladies and different travel facts in practically every other sentence.  With her method it's more like you are reading a dictionary than a novel.  Because there is so much history compacted into a few pages, you never quite get engulfed in the story of the moment.  Instead, you are given the name of each woman and the book(s) she wrote and only a tiny bit about her travels.<br \/><br \/>At the beginning I rated the book a 2.  However, the author changed her style in the later pages and the book moved up to a 3 and finally an 4 with my looking forward to reading it in the evening.  In fact if I read it again, I'd probably enjoy it more and increase the ratings.<br \/><br \/>As the story progresses, she elaborates on the travels of some of the women so that you can get a better understanding of the hardships and in some cases, the enjoyment, they endured.  I've learned that the Sandwich Islands are Hawaii and that many women were really pioneers in the way they traveled back then.  Many endured diseases and actually died during travel.  Others weren't lone travelers; sometimes traveling as a result of a husband's wishes.  However, I really can't remember a single female name because there were so many.  Those who are interested in historical facts, names and dates would love this book.<br \/><br \/>\"No Place for a Lady\" turned out to be a very interesting read but did leave me wanting for more.  It is extremely evident that the author did tremendous research and reading in order to produce this work.  I suspect one would get more appreciation for what women travelers encountered if they read each book the author did during her research.","images":[],"asin":"1580084419","parent_asin":"1580084419","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1060779119000,"helpful_vote":9,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1720,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Fun story, very, VERY similar to The Maze Runner in plot, characters and world","text":"I love a good dystopian plot and The Initiation delivers for the most part. The world building is fairly well done with just a few plot holes, but it's easy to picture as you read. The bleak, hungry, grey world is stark and offers numerous questions about why and how it became that way. The answers are provided and they are a reasonably believable. The characters are annoying, even whiny for the first quarter of the book, but they definitely develop more as the actual Initiation tests begin. Once you cross the halfway mark, the book sort of takes off with lots of action, very interesting puzzles and it doesn't slow down until the last few pages.<br \/><br \/>I have two complaints - this is a set up for yet another multi-book series instead of a fully fleshed out stand alone story. I'm really tired of being milked for as much money as possible by every author in a bookstore. However, my main reason for the star deduction is because this entire story just screams &#34;Maze Runner&#34; to me from the first chapters through the end. A group of mismatched teens, an obstacle course of dangerous trials, big government conspiracy, special covert operation for the surviving kids, all set in a dystopian future. The Initiation is so close to Maze Runner that I'm surprised the publisher allowed it.","images":[],"asin":"1682615936","parent_asin":"1682615936","user_id":"AHPOHKN4PU4W3V5PGFL7AGTAD2AA","timestamp":1515268967366,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1305,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Mildly Amusing Historical Cozy Featuring Bored Housewife in 1893 Poland","text":"MRS. MOHR GOES MISSING (A ZOFIA TURBOTYNSKA MYSTERY) is an historical cozy mystery set in 1893 in Poland--specifically in provincial Cracow during the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Thus the novel abounds with aristocrats (countesses, baronesses, etc.), professors, and peasants, and the story describes a society with strictly defined classes.<br \/><br \/>The main character (Zofia) is quite well-to-do (a university professor’s wife).  She is basically a bored housewife, but is also an avid social climber, and a devoted reader of mystery novels.  In this mystery--well-translated from the Polish--Zofia is attempting to improve her social position by performing charitable works.<br \/><br \/>In the course of organizing a raffle to benefit scrofulous children, Zofia learns that a wealthy resident of Helcel House (a nursing home run by the Sisters of Charity) has disappeared.  Zofia visits Helcel House, surreptitiously interviews staff and residents, and causes the discovery of the missing woman’s body.  Zofia is convinced that the woman was murdered, and eventually unravels the mystery surrounding the murder, a subsequent murder, and a subsequent disappearance.<br \/><br \/>The novel is amusing, because of (1) Zofia’s forceful opinions; (2) her manipulation of her husband, of a terrified nun at Helcel House, of her servants, and of everyone else she finds useful; and (3) her intense focus on seeing--and being seen with--the creme de la creme of Cracovian society.  However, Zofia’s social-climbing becomes tiresome long before the Helcel House mystery is solved.<br \/><br \/>The characters’ long Polish and Hungarian names add some difficulty for the reader.  However, the worst thing about this novel is that the plot seems to be a very conventional mystery plot that is mechanically superimposed onto the researched historical setting.  The disconnect made me lose interest in Zofia and the story about halfway through.  The ending is satisfying enough, but I didn’t like the book well enough to want to read any more Zofia Turbontynska mysteries.","images":[],"asin":"0358161460","parent_asin":"0358161460","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1588978382570,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2069,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Its an Eric Vall tale, expect pages of bad erotica surrounded by a half-way decent plot.","text":"The plot idea is interesting.  A young man from Earth is somehow spiritually dragged into another world where 3 young women claim to be his priestesses await.  Of course, the devoutness of his priestesses vary, as does his own belief in his divinity.  But he's a gamer so he plays along and near the end, discovers he can manifest in the world, where he behaves as one might expert if they have read many harem fantasy tales.<br \/><br \/>Sadly, while the idea is good, the rest suffers from the usual flaws from the genre.  The female characters have no depth, and are fantasy fodder most of the time, with the main character often obsessively observing how much flesh is revealed by their priestess garb.  The hero himself is worse.  He's not intelligent, he's always thinking with his lower head, he is condescending to the girls multiple times.  He's just a jerk of the first water that honestly I didn't want to read about.<br \/><br \/>And after he can manifest in the world I wanted to snooze through the rest of the book as it seemed to become one very long and boring sex scene.<br \/><br \/>Its not terrible.<br \/>Its actually well edited and flows rather well.<br \/>but even if this could be considered \"porn with a plot\".

{"rating":3,"title":"America's Flawed Legal System","text":"Ruthless is an unusual book about an ordinary guy from Atlanta, Georgia who finds himself in possession of some shocking stories about a hugely popular celebrity. The author was supposedly having a conversation one day with a total stranger on the telephone, when the stranger revealed that he was employed by Harpo- the business enterprise run by Oprah Winfrey. This person began to tell all sorts of tales about Harpo and its CEO, prompting Bonvillain to record the conversations. He had no idea what he was about to discover, not to mention the whirlwind of controversy and legal trouble that his recorded phone conversations would create.<br \/><br \/>This book contains many accusations against Oprah Winfrey and I found myself taking sides- and changing my mind several times- as I read each page. The story at first seems far- fetched, but these events really did take place and there are tape excerpts to back everything up. The conversations are very eye- opening, but they also present many questions. Why would this guy call a total stranger and start to tell him all sorts of negative things about Oprah Winfrey? Was this guy telling the truth? Was he just blowing off steam about his dissatisfaction with Harpo? And why did Bonvillain tape record the conversations? Was his mind set on making money from the beginning? At first, it seemed like Bonvillain was, indeed, just looking for a way to make an easy buck by selling some juicy gossip to the highest bidder. But the more I read, the more I started to wonder. It does seem odd that a total stranger would divulge so much information to another person. But on the other hand, why would he say this if it wasn't true? And why would he go on and on about the issues he had with Harpo and Oprah Winfrey if there wasn't at least some degree of truth to the allegations?<br \/><br \/>Ruthless includes many of the actual taped conversations between Keifer Bonvillain and Harpo attorney Bill Becker. This part of the book is rather repetitive, but also very revealing. Becker seems very worried and also highly suspicious- like he is up to no good and is trying to frame Bonvillain in some way. As you read, you later discover that framing Bonvillain was, indeed, Becker's plan all along. He discussed purchasing book rights to the tapes and was very clear that this is what he wanted to do. Then, when the two men were supposed to meet to discuss the deal, the FBI was waiting to arrest Bonvillain and accuse him of extortion. At this point, I started to feel a little sorry for Bonvillain, not to mention disgust with the Harpo business in general and the FBI. Becker lies to Bonvillain repeatedly and Bonvillain struggles over whether or not to trust him before they ever met. Finally, he decides to place his trust in Becker only to experience the ultimate betrayal in the end. The charges were eventually dropped, but not because the legal system worked to find the truth. The charges were dropped because Bonvillain had secretly recorded the conversations between himself and Becker, proving that he was framed.<br \/><br \/>Ruthless is not the type of book that will appeal to everyone. I found it a little slow at first, but it picks up momentum near the end and some of its revelations are quite shocking. I never would have thought of Oprah Winfrey as the type who would practice discrimination, but the book claims this is true and that anyone in doubt can look up the facts on the internet by conducting some simple research. A little more scientific evidence, however, would have been helpful and would have made the case stronger. It also would have been nice if the book had included some appendices, notes, etc. at the end of the book. The book's position would have been more believable if it provided some notes on sources.<br \/><br \/>Overall, Ruthless is a book I recommend reading for its insight into the flawed legal system and, to a lesser extent, its revealing information about Harpo and Oprah Winfrey. The author's hands are not completely clean since he did, after all, decide to record these phone conversations without the other parties consent. But the betrayal he experienced and the false arrest at the hands of the FBI are reason for concern and they point out the many problems with the legal system in the United States. It could be worse, yes. But the lying and framing by the FBI and other legal organizations is something that needs to be addressed more frequently and citizens need to be more fully aware of these practices and their long- term consequences.","images":[],"asin":"0980104904","parent_asin":"0980104904","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1213291516000,"helpful_vote":14,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4552,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Great race descriptions soured by self indulgent nonsense","text":"As a woman who has spent my life riding, showing and training horses in multiple disciplines, I can absolutely relate to love of horses and the desire for an adventure on horseback. Sort of that foggy romanticized vision of horses equalling freedom of spirit. So I was excited to read this story of a young woman's daring acceptance of the Mongolian Derby challenge.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, what I got was the ramblings and navel gazing of a child who was far more reckless, immature and sloppy than daring or admirable. I really didn't care for her at all and frankly, found everything about her slightly....off. At first I thought she was just ditzy and truly in over her head without being savvy enough to recognize it. However, by the end of the book, I find myself suspecting the author has shined us on with a fake persona to generate extra attention. In the end, it feels like she harbors disdain for the other riders, the local culture and customs of the Mongolians and even a few of the ponies she rode.<br \/><br \/>The race itself and descriptions of the horses and their personalities was fascinating and very well done. The hardships of the bad weather, wild endless spaces, loneliness and physical strain were just as vivid and compellingly written. I think this would be a five star book if there had been better editing and photos included. The smooth action of the actual race is ruined in every chapter by random daydreams, descriptions of her sleeping dreams and just stream of consciousness ramblings. It's disjointed and jarring. Eliminate most of that and distill this down to the purity of the race experience and this is a book worth reading and enjoying.","images":[],"asin":"1948226197","parent_asin":"1948226197","user_id":"AHPOHKN4PU4W3V5PGFL7AGTAD2AA","timestamp":1555215430794,"helpful_vote":64,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1679,"length_group":3}

{"rating":3,"title":"A decent sophomore effort","text":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's [[ASIN:0440228166 In the Forests of the Night]] was written when she was only 13 years old. In it, she chronicled the unlife of Risika and her tangles with Aubrey, a fellow vampire whom she believes killed her human brother. In Demon in My View, several characters from her debut novel are back, with Aubrey front and center. This time, the novel's protagonist is Jessica, a conveniently depressed Goth who secretly publishes fantasy novels under the pen name Ash Night that revolve around vampire culture. The inspiration for her characters comes to her in her dreams, or rather, her nightmares. Adopted Jessica is a loner and quick to anger, so when a new boy enrolls at school who looks, sounds, and acts just like Aubrey, her world is thrown into confusion.<br \/><br \/>Atwater-Rhodes displays skill at building atmosphere and of creating a viable backstory and genealogy for her vampires. However, the plot is thin at best, and the writing of the flashbacks seem stilted and juvenile. The many secondary characters are fleeting at best; we're never really given their motivations, such as the brief appearances and disappearances of vampire hunter Dominique Vida and witch Hasana Rashida. The vampires' lives are much more fleshed-out than the humans, including Caryn and her family, witches and descendants of powerful Healers. As I've read elsewhere, there is no clear motivation for introducing Wicca, as spells are never cast nor is magick brought up.<br \/><br \/>Although Atwater-Rhodes attempts to create a standalone universe through her vampire and witch genealogies, but the writing felt juvenile at at times self-centered (gorgeous teen author has a body to die for and is talented, strong...we get it already!), and many plot twists were predictable (her uneven attempt at foreshadowing gave away one of the major \"surprises\" early on). However, it was a quick, entertaining read (I breezed through it in about 45 minutes) that, although not original, was generally well-written, especially from one so young; it's certainly no worse than a lot of young adult vampire series on the market.","images":[],"asin":"0440228840","parent_asin":"0440228840","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1205456984000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2127,"length_group":3}

{"rating":3,"title":"Ruth Galloway Sorts Love Life While on Holiday in Italy","text":"The “Ruth Galloway” series falls in between the “police procedural” and “cozy” mystery genres, if the two “Galloway” novels that I’ve read (books 9 and 10) are typical.  They feature an overweight, frumpy, but highly intelligent archaeologist (Ruth), and a stalled-in-his-police-career detective (DCI Nelson); the plots are as much about personal  relationships as they are about solving crimes.  I like the unpretentious, solitary Ruth character very much.<br \/><br \/>In THE DARK ANGEL (RUTH GALLOWAY MYSTERIES BOOK 10), Ruth is a happy single mother who’s still in love with daughter Kate’s married father Nelson.  Nelson is unhappy, torn between his two families--pregnant wife Michelle and adult daughters Laura and Rebecca, and his true love Ruth and small daughter Kate.  Things are complicated, because Michelle’s baby may not be Nelson’s, and the baby’s father may be a black man.<br \/><br \/>When Ruth is asked by a former lover (Angelo) to consult on skeletal bones from a Roman dig site in Italy, she leaps at the chance to have a working holiday abroad.  She and close friend Shona travel with their small children to (fictional) Castello degli Angeli in the Liri Valley, and land in the middle of the town’s buried secrets.<br \/><br \/>The Roman bones that brought Ruth to Italy are insignificant, but after the beloved parish priest is murdered and an earthquake unearths some much more recent bones, the four English tourists find that their lives are in danger.  They welcome the arrival of Nelson, along with Ruth’s nutty friend Cathbad, to help figure things out.<br \/><br \/>The 10th series book is primarily a vehicle for Ruth to sort out her love life, though her situation is still unresolved at book’s end.  (There’s even a cliffhanger involving somebody from Ruth’s past named Frank.) The plot is rather boring--not much to be investigated--and the ending is contrived and unsatisfying.

{"rating":3,"title":"Unwieldy Collection of Lace Stitch Patterns From VK Magazine","text":"If you already own the previous four volumes in the STITCHIONARY series, you may want to purchase VOGUE KNITTING STITCHIONARY VOLUME FIVE: LACE KNITTING to complete your set.  However, VOLUME FIVE is nothing more than a rather unwieldy coffee-table-book collection of \"more than 150\" lace stitch patterns \"taken from the pages of Vogue Knitting magazine.\"<br \/><br \/>The patterns are organized into general categories: easy\/mesh, edgings, chevrons, allover, panels, combos, and motifs.  However, the \"lace knitting\" title is misleading, because there is no instructional material on (1) combining lace stitch patterns into garments, shawls, or stoles; (2) selecting patterns that are appropriate for different kinds of projects; (3) attaching edgings; or (4) understanding or using the charts and written-out instructions.<br \/><br \/>There is one page of instructions for yarnovers (illustrated with line drawings).  This page appears to be taken from the publisher's very good general reference book, VOGUE KNITTING.  There is also a short glossary of knitting terms used in the book.  For each stitch pattern, there is a beautiful, enlarged, color photo of a swatch knitted in the pattern.  The selection of patterns is somewhat random, because VK magazine is the pattern source, but many basic lace patterns are included. There are also quite a few complicated \"designer\" patterns (evidently created for specific patterns published in the magazine) that may be of limited practical value to knitters seeking ideas for lace items of their own design.<br \/><br \/>Many other stitch dictionaries are currently available that provide more patterns, and therefore offer better value (e.g., the Mon Tricot stitch dictionaries, the Barbara Walker stitch treasuries, the Lesley Stanfield stitch treasuries).  One very good lace stitch treasury is HARMONY GUIDES: LACE & EYELETS: 250 STITCHES TO KNIT.  One general stitch treasury that includes a good sampling of lace patterns and edgings is the Reader's Digest ULTIMATE SOURCEBOOK OF KNITTING AND CROCHET STITCHES.  Two excellent books that provide copious instruction on lace knitting and designing, as well as some lace stitch patterns, are Sharon Miller's HEIRLOOM KNITS and Jane Sowerby's VICTORIAN LACE TODAY.","images":[],"asin":"1933027932","parent_asin":"1933027932","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1275329949000,"helpful_vote":99,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2259,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Just did not connect - okay historical fiction mystery\/romance","text":"This historical fiction\/romance\/mystery alternates between Paris just before the Nazi occupation and a house on the French Riviera in the present. The WWII part centers on Eliane, a young woman who works at the Louvre, attends some of its art history classes and works in her parents' unsuccessful restaurant. Present day is about Remy, who is staying in her home on the Riviera, still trying to come to terms with the accidental deaths of her husband and daughter two years ago. She has a mysterious past, she meets a handsome guy, she's afraid to fall in love. Eliane gets involved with efforts of real life Rose Valland who worked to retain records of every piece of art stolen by the Nazis from private French collections and spent her post WWII years helping to recover masterpieces stolen from Jews primarily. The historic parts of the book are fine, but not new to me and certainly not the best treatment of the subject I've read. But accurate enough and the fictional liberties taken are logical. The mystery about Remy's roots and the house and a painting she inherited is entertaining but does not emotionally move me. The relationships and romantic intrigue and the relationships among members of the resistance are just not believable. Well-written, but I am not particularly rooting for any relationship in this novel. Although reasons are constructed for each character's behavior they are not convincing but irritating. So the writing is good, but the plot and characters' motivations, etc., not so much. The true pain of Nazi occupation and the fates of people who are caught are described but just in brush strokes that do not move me, having read memoirs, novels and articles on these issues that gut me. This did not gut me. A story like this should gut me.","images":[],"asin":"B08PV5N7Z6","parent_asin":"B08PV5N7Z6","user_id":"AEZ26WGWJ3EOQ4KWSHG77HJAG4EA","timestamp":1643137135558,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1776,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"This was more of a reminder to me of why I pursue my passions than a self-help book","text":"To me this book is full of common sense because it has been the way I conduct my life since youth. I found this more of a reminder of how passion can be either fulfilling or destructive. The reminders in the margins are excellent and the conclusion chapter is really what the book is about in two-pages.<br \/><br \/>EXAMPLES of REMINDERS:<br \/><br \/>- \"The best route to making your passion a bigger part of your life is to do so gradually.\"<br \/><br \/>- \"Someone who embodies the mastery mind-set judges herself not on whether she accomplishes her goal but rather on how well she executes on her process.\"<br \/><br \/>MY UNDERSTANDING:<br \/><br \/>The sentences below sums up what this book is to me and not necessarily what was exactly said or meant in the text:<br \/><br \/>- Pursuing an interest and becoming a successful master (or mistress) requires being intrinsically motivated to achieve results rather than being externally motivated on reaching the goal. In other words, satisfaction and passion must come from within otherwise it can become toxic.<br \/><br \/>- One must be self-aware and re-evaluate their passion.<br \/><br \/>- Pursuing a passion means life is unbalanced by default but if we look at our entire life as a whole, we are usually balanced.<br \/><br \/>- We must be patient and keep striving toward our passion to achieve success.<br \/><br \/>- Some of us may have many passions and choose to re-evaluate where we are at different times in our lives so as to re-direct our passions.<br \/><br \/>- What helps us to achieve the life we want is to think about death, This helps us realize there is only so much time that we have so we should be doing what moves us.<br \/><br \/>- There is a fine line between passion and obsession.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this felt like a pep-talk and a reminder of how I already live. I was not personally enlightened although I did appreciate the inspiring notes in the margin.","images":[],"asin":"1635653436","parent_asin":"1635653436","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1553045227195,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1926,"length_group":3}

The characters seemed to be multi-dimensional and had lives that intertwined with the plot, bringing a depth to the tale you don't often find.<br \/><br \/>Sadly, the sequel failed to build on the same foundation.  We do see several characters return, but their development and growth was stunted by a fragmented plot.  Worse, multiple new characters are named and described, but receive almost no attention except as scene filler.  New heroes participate in battles and intrigues, but I never felt they got enough \"screen time\" to really develop.<br \/><br \/>This and the fact that the main plot felt forced brought the book down quite a bit.  I read straight through this, and do hope to see more in the future, but in the end I felt cheated by the ending and the fact that I never really saw heroes I could cheer for like I did in the first book.  Even the returning ones lost a lot of their appeal during this tale.<br \/><br \/>It's clear that this husband and wife team of writers are still finding their voice.  They have created an interesting world, and there is definitely a lot of potential in several of their characters.  I hope they write more.<br \/><br \/>If you like West Pacific Supers: Rising Tide, you'll most likely enjoy this story.  Just don't expect it to be as good.

In the quiet community of Avalon, Illinois, Julia Evarts wonders how to move on with her life. Though her husband and five-year-old daughter give her an abundance of love, Julia still reels from a tragedy that has left her estranged from the sister who was once her best friend. Meanwhile, across town, widow Madeleine Davis takes great pleasure in serving up delectable treats and cozy comforts at her tea salon--now, if only she had some customers to enjoy them. And famed concert cellist and recent Avalon transplant Hannah de Brisay finds herself at a crossroads when her career and marriage come to abrupt ends. The three strangers forge a friendship at Madeleine's Tea Shop, and soon their camaraderie extends to everyone in Avalon in the guise of a unique and wonderful gift. But even as Julia becomes ever closer to her new friends, she realizes the profound necessity of confronting the painful past she shares with her sister.  Life and loss, friendship and community, food and family: Friendship Bread tells a spirited, remarkably moving tale about the triumph of hope. From Publishers Weekly: Baked goods conquer profound grief in Gee's by-the-numbers debut. The sorrow felt by Julia Evarts and her husband, Mark, over the death of their son, Josh, six years earlier has chipped away at the foundation of their marriage, but after Julia finds a starter batch of Amish friendship bread on her porch one day, the yeasty surprise helps patch up some spiritual wounds. She shares the recipe starter with a few people in her town, and pretty soon everyone is making it and finding their own simple narratives of bread-driven healing. But none have a harder path to the foregone conclusion than Julia and her sister, Livvy, who was with Josh when he died and has yet to be forgiven by Julia. Yes, the premise is hokey, but Gee's women characters are written with affection (much more so than the men in their lives, who are essentially decorative). Readers looking for a quick, easy fix of heartwarming optimism could do worse. And, of course, the recipe is included.","images":[],"asin":"034552537X","parent_asin":"034552537X","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1360806462000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2979,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Routine Police Procedural Spends Too Much Time on Medical Issues","text":"Early in THE DYING DETECTIVE: A MYSTERY, the detective (Johansson) has a stroke.  The novel gets the stroke symptoms, rehab, and treatment right, but this material fills far too much of the book. And it's depressing to read about a main character who is supposedly dying, even though it's the man’s lifestyle (and resulting heart disease), not the stroke itself, that's killing him.<br \/><br \/>As a mystery, this is a very ordinary police procedural.  Johansson's physician (Ulrika) hands him a cold case involving a murdered child, and he is able to identify the likely suspect very quickly because no one pursued the original investigation very seriously.  Johansson gives fact-finding assignments to various helpers, including a couple of caregivers (Matilda and Max).  When the suspect’s guilt is proved, Johansson and his helpers must find an unorthodox way to bring the man to justice--because the statute of limitations on the child’s murder has expired, making the murderer immune from normal prosecution and trial.<br \/><br \/>The translation from the Swedish is good, but this is a slow-moving story without much plot.  A moderately interesting subplot--connected with the murderer’s ability to escape detection for more than 25 years--involves sexual abuse of children in Thailand by pedophile tourists.","images":[],"asin":"0307907635","parent_asin":"0307907635","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1491165145000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1313,"length_group":3}

Practically every recipe called for his coconut oil or an equivalent. There were also some other ingredients I don't like such as pomegranate seeds, okra, curry powder, Guinness, golden syrup, molasses, etc. I would be hard pressed to include these items in any recipe of mine.

{"rating":3,"title":"Despite loving the original, I just couldn't get into it","text":"I loved Nancy Haddock's [[ASIN:042521995X La Vida Vampire (Oldest City Vampire, Book 1)]]; the heroine Cesca is a very hip, snarky gal who loves surfing and home decorating, works as a ghost tour guide, and oh, happens to be a vampire who hates blood (it makes her queasy, and she'll only drink caramel macchiato-flavored blood from Starbloods). In \"Last Vampire Standing,\" Cesca ends up aiding Jo-Jo, a fugitive vamp who seeks to be America's next greatest comic and also serves as Cesca's instructor for flying lessons. The original novel was snappy and funny, but \"Last Vampire Standing\" never gets off the ground, much like Cesca's attempts at flight.<br \/><br \/>Part of the plot is a carryover from \"La Vida Vampire\": Cesca's girlhood crush on Triton plays a role in \"Last Vampire Standing,\" and Pandora the shapeshifter is back, as is Cesca's love interest, Deke Saber. Now for the bad: the numerous plot threads dangle (example: a major character makes an appearance in the first twenty pages, and isn't heard from again until Chapter 21). I just wasn't interested in the several weak side plots. The novel dragged along; sexual innuendo and bedroom romps serve as frequent page filler rather than actual action or intrigue (sort of parallel to Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Series' slide into Sookie's bedroom antics). I realize that this is a paranormal romance, but Cesca was an innocent, blushing vampire virgin in the first book; she seems to have been attending Kama Sutra cram sessions in the interim. We do get to see more of Cesca's psychic powers in use, but there are no other vampire powers at work (the flying lessons were a definite dud). The flashbacks to Cesca's human life were well-drawn; I would have liked to hear more historical details from early St. Augustine.<br \/><br \/>Jo-Jo is a weak, annoying character. You'd think after centuries of experience as a court jester, he'd have picked up some remotely funny one-liners, but no. He doesn't really serve much of a purpose; although he swears to serve as Cesca's protector, he's never around after getting a contract with a high-powered agent and ditching Cesca for Leno and Oprah (amazing, since the guy has ZERO talent except for the vampire novelty factor). The novel's baddies are just mere sketches, here and then gone, and the central plot point appears in one chapter and is never fully explored. There is some good material here, but it needed to be more developed (the various plots lack cohesiveness and the secondary characters are forgettable). I really wanted to like this after loving \"La Vida Vampire,\" but it was a struggle to finish reading it.","images":[],"asin":"0425227545","parent_asin":"0425227545","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1251847862000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2646,"length_group":3}

{"rating":3,"title":"Jim Hightower's Recipe for a Better America","text":"Do corporations have too much political influence? That is the main question presented in this book by Jim Hightower. Politicians, it seems, are no longer responsive to the needs of the people and have now placed money and power over principle. In this book, Jim Hightower discusses the problems presented by greedy CEO's and the corrupt politicians who happily accept their cash and he mostly succeeds at presenting a good piece of reading material, full of good thinking points and plenty of humor.<br \/><br \/>Some of Hightower's viewpoints will not resonate well with every reader, since his positions are almost entirely of the liberal persuasion, but he does have a few good points to make. Hightower attacks corporations for spreading their culture of greed into small towns across the land. He criticizes companies and government officials for not doing more to protect the environment. And, more than anything else, he blasts the Bush administration for its numerous failed policies. He feels that George W. Bush is the root of all evil and that we, the people, need to do all we can to minimize the negative effects of his presidency.<br \/><br \/>This book succeeds in some areas and fails in others. Hightower is definitely correct when he points out how politicians are quickly selling out to corporate donors in return for some quick and easy campaign money. He is also correct when he points out the many failings of government, like the disastrous war on drugs and the many invasions of privacy that our government commits every day, mostly in the name of fighting terrorists. But in other areas, Hightower's views seem a little tainted. He holds democracy to the highest level, but where would he draw the line in his political thinking? Don't individuals need to have some rights to protect against the wishes of the majority? Hightower doesn't say much about this. He seems to think that whatever benefits the most people is the way to go.<br \/><br \/>One other thing you should know about this book is that it doesn't provide very much intellectual analysis to back its claims. Hightower seems to think that, since his position is the correct one, he doesn't need to do much else to persuade the reader. It would be helpful- not to mention more convincing- if Hightower would present some analysis to back his positions.<br \/><br \/>Corporations exert quite a bit of influence on politics. But is the power they wield greater than it should be? In the opinion of Jim Hightower, the answer is yes, it is. Hightower feels that everyone should get off their behinds and work in support for populist causes and populist candidates for office. Inaction is the greatest sin of all, and everyone needs to work for change if they want to rid the U.S. of excessive corporate influence and return the country to the rule of the people.","images":[],"asin":"0670031410","parent_asin":"0670031410","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1113183417000,"helpful_vote":9,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2840,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Some decent recipes, but Kindle edition is not great ...","text":"I collect cookbooks, and I'm sometimes faced with the prospect of cooking in a kitchen that doesn't \"measure up\" in terms of size, storage, layout, etc.  It's nice to have recipes intended to work in that kind of environment -- even recipes that date from 40 yrs ago (the original hardcover book was published in 1979).<br \/><br \/>This book is ... OK ... for that purpose.  There are some good tips in the introductory material for outfitting a small kitchen, how to maximize minimal spaces, the bare minimum in pans and utensils that will save on storage, etc.  The recipes themselves are not bad, although there are more than a few that I know I'll never prepare.<br \/><br \/>So let's get right to the recipes.  My usual practice is to prepare 3 recipes from any cookbook I review, and I followed that protocol here.<br \/><br \/>1.  South African Style Lamb and Black-Eyed Peas<br \/>Made with lamb shoulder, onion, green chilis, lemon juice, curry powder, garlic, and black-eyed peas.<br \/>A nice flavorful lamb casserole, rich and fragrant.  However, instructions need editing: the ingredient list calls for “2 pounds lamb shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes,” while the recipe says “ … return to oven until meat is nearly falling off the bones.”  Uh … which bones?  In order to cut it into 1-inch cubes, I had to take the meat off the bone, so there’s no bone for the meat to fall off of.  The dish was tasty and I'll make it again.  I served it with a fairly plain green salad (romaine and butter lettuce with jicama slivers) with a pomegranate vinaigrette.<br \/><br \/>2.  Flank Steak with Whole-Pepper Marinade<br \/>I used a 1 lb flank steak and cut the recipe in half.  The marinade is made from cracked black peppercorns, onion, garlic, bay leaf, red wine, olive oil, and cognac.  I marinated it for 24 hrs and grilled it on my outdoor gas grill.  Easy, no-fuss, and good results.  I served it with the accompanying “suggested” side dish: Orange-Glazed Carrot Ribbons — another really easy stove-top dish, using carrots cut into thin ribbons via a vegetable peeler, then sautéd in butter and finished with orange juice cooked down to a syrupy glaze.<br \/><br \/>3.  Caribbean Fudge Pie<br \/>Chocolate, rum, coffee, walnuts — what’s not to like?  This was easier than it sounds — basically, a chocolate pie that comes together easily by mixing butter, melted chocolate, rum, brown sugar, instant coffee, eggs, chopped walnuts and a little flour, baked in a 9-inch pie shell (I used a frozen deep-dish pie shell).  Nothing tricky at all — served it with whipped cream.  It’s rich, decadent, and worth the calories.<br \/><br \/>My biggest beef with this book, however, is the Kindle formatting.  There's a broad table of contents organized by category but no way to select an individual recipe.  Also, the categories don't make a lot of sense.  For example, there's no chapter for meat\/poultry\/fish.  You get \"One-Pot Dinners,\" \"Skillet Cooking,\" and \"Dinners for Two\" (or \"Four\") along with \"Desserts,\" \"Soups,\" \"Pasta,\" \"Salads and Raw Foods.\"  So where can I find a recipe for chicken?  Let's try the Index.  Yes, there's an Index, but it's totally unusable as there are NO links back to the referenced recipe or ingredient and no page numbers.  So if I find, say, \"Chicken, and asparagus in black bean sauce\" in the Index, I have no idea where to begin to look for the recipe.  Is it in \"One-Pot Dinners\"? \"Dinners for Four\"? or somewhere else?  No clue.  No, I have to use Kindle's \"Search\" feature (I used the search term \"Asparagus\" and got 47 matches) in order to find the recipe.  I've had this gripe before with Kindle \"translations\" of cookbooks, but this Kindle edition was just released in 2018 -- you'd think the publisher would have it figured out how to do this properly.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I can't really give this more than 3 stars.  While some of the recipes look interesting (and the 3 I tried were more or less OK), I'm not patient enough to try to slog through the limited table of contents and non-functioning Index to discover something new and creative to prepare.  If you're really interested in adding this book to your collection, I'd recommend getting the hardcover edition -- it's cheaper than the Kindle edition and will be easier to use.","images":[],"asin":"B076PD2CMX","parent_asin":"B076PD2CMX","user_id":"AHRGTIMQO47C2VLJILIDU53BQKSA","timestamp":1561580366320,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"length":4267,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"The main message of this book is to STOP RUMINATING (worrying or catastrophizing) as STRESS IS OPTIIONAL","text":"I am not as enamored with this book as the other reviewers. The premise of the entire book is that stress is optional and is caused by rumination. There’s a four step process of waking up, controlling attention, becoming detached, and letting go that builds resilience which leads to a life without stress.<br \/><br \/>Below is what I understood the author to be saying:<br \/>- Rumination refers to unnecessarily worrying and emotionally hashing out details over and over.<br \/>- Waking up is the ability to be present in thought and not drift off in thought to the past or future.<br \/>- Controlling attention is the ability of being in the moment and aware of what is around you.<br \/>- Becoming detached is the ability of maintaining perspective.<br \/>- Letting go is the ability of not staying locked into one scenario or emotion.<br \/>- &quot;Resilience is the ability to negotiate the rapids of life without becoming stressed.&quot; Resilience is also enhanced by one’s sensitivity which requires one to quickly and accurately assess how others feel.<br \/><br \/>Although this text included some other gems of information such as describing the two Rs of leadership (leaders with “relationship” and “requiring” skills), I found that “Work Without Stress” could have been summed up eloquently in less than 50 pages.<br \/><br \/>I felt this book only started to address the leadership side of the equation from Page 59 onward as Pages 1-58 were more background in nature about rumination, stress, resilience, etc.  Also, pages 169 to 198 contain the Appendix which describes the science (or studies) behind the theory and that text wasn’t as interesting to me.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this text captured my attention sporadically. I found it to be repetitive and a bit unorganized. It is definitely a worthwhile read but I do not feel that I learned much other than what I highlighted in the above list. The main message is “STOP RUMINATING.”","images":[],"asin":"1259642968","parent_asin":"1259642968","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1479668865000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1939,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Rice without rhythm","text":"This is a fanciful tale of a grain of Patna rice that accidentally winds up on board a ship bound for the New World.  He escapes the fate of his fellow grains in the hold of the ship when a sailor steps on him and he gets stuck to the bottom of the sailor's shoe.<br \/><br \/>Along the way, he makes friends with a Myna bird named Trupti, who patiently explains that it's highly unlikely that he's ever going to see India again.  Having debated that issue, they are then set upon by the ship's dog, who certainly doesn't like sharing his domain with talking birds and rice grains.<br \/><br \/>The illustrations are in color and are certainly kid-friendly, but there are two things that I didn't like about this book.  First of all, the layout uses several different fonts, in varying colors and sizes, and it is sometimes difficult to follow the story in sequence.  Secondly, the intention is to tell the tale in rhyme, but the meter is totally off and many of the words don't even come close to rhyming.  This makes it hard to read out loud to young children.

{"rating":3,"title":"Book About Data Analytics Has Misleading Title","text":"The title of this book is highly misleading.  THE HIGH ROLLER EXPERIENCE: HOW CAESARS AND OTHER WORLD-CLASS COMPANIES ARE USING DATA TO CREATE AN UNFORGETTABLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE contains almost nothing about the special perks (high-roller experience) provided to VIP customers at “world-class” companies.<br \/><br \/>Instead, the book is all about data analytics, and how big companies can use data to design the most effective customer loyalty rewards programs.  The main message is that rewards programs should be tied to the profitability of types of customer behavior, rather than to the dollar-amounts spent by individual customers.  For example, slot machines are more or less profitable (by the casino’s share, or “hold”), depending on the customers’ machine choices.  Thus the casino’s loyalty program should be designed to reward the customers who use the profitable types of machines, rather than to reward the customers who spend the most dollars.<br \/><br \/>The book appears to be sound in its analytics, and will no doubt be of considerable interest to business people with customer rewards programs, and to data analysts in general.  However, it’s of no interest at all to casual readers who would like to know more about the perks actually extended to Las Vegas’ regular high rollers.","images":[],"asin":"125986295X","parent_asin":"125986295X","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1533051947095,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1300,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Two different women with different philosophies; both can have a successful life","text":"Before this book I never heard of the famous Italian designer Elsa Schiaparelli. \"Shocked\" is about the differences between the author Patricia's mother Audrey Volk and Elsa Schiaparelli.  Audrey's husband buys Schiaparelli's perfume \"Shocking\" for his wife's birthday every year.  Patricia outlines in extreme detail nuanced differences between the way her mother conducted her life and the way Schiap (short for Schiaparelli) conducted hers.  The author goes into detail about everything. She dedicates paragraphs and pages to describing the way her mother applies makeup or perfume to the darning of her husband's socks or to the way Schiaparelli lives her life. I started out liking this book but in the end I felt it was just okay.  I was confused by the story because after finishing the book I still do not understand the relationship between the author, her mother, or Schiap other than the author's mother was a customer. In my opinion I felt that Patricia was describing in conflicting detail how confused she was by her up-bringing and the differences between these two women.  However, in the end she realized it does not really matter how she conducts her life or what she believes because \"anything is possible.\"<br \/><br \/>PS - The sketches in the book are exceptional and my favorite is the one depicting the living room designed by Salvador Dali for Schiaparelli that was furnished by Mae West's face.","images":[],"asin":"0307962105","parent_asin":"0307962105","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1372523439000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1418,"length_group":3}

{"rating":3,"title":"Good, Practical Advice on Preventing Personal Fraud","text":"Author Michael Hyatt is a best- selling author and speaker who wrote this book to advise individuals on ways to protect themselves in today's digital age. He feels that we need to be aware of the everyday dangers to our personal privacy, and that we should not take this issue lightly.<br \/>Hyatt begins the book by discussing the supposed &quot;threat&quot; that exists today, from corporations, individuals, and the government. According to Hyatt, there are threats to your privacy that are all around you, and some are not so obvious to the naked eye. Most of us are aware of some of the threats, like government surveillance and Social Security number theft. But other privacy threats are not quite so obvious, like the threat imposed by using supermarket credit cards. Through the use of these cards, the store is able to keep tabs on all sorts of personal data, which is often more information than many people would want them to have.<br \/>In the second and third parts of the book, Hyatt talks about specific strategies to use, to minimize the problems that are caused by invasions of privacy. He recommends, for instance, using a P.O. Box, whenever practical, instead of your home address, to avoid letting others know exactly where you live. He also recommends not carrying your Social Security Card in your wallet, and getting your Social Security number removed from your driver's license and other forms of ID, to reduce the chances of identity theft.<br \/>Hyatt wraps of the book with several appendices that are meant to assist the individual in assessing his\/her privacy knowledge and risk. There's a privacy self assessment test; a privacy checklist; privacy resource list; family privacy policy; and a public servant questionnaire.<br \/>Hyatt seems a little obsessed with his concerns about privacy, and many readers might think he borders on being paranoid. Are we really in this much danger, to justify taking all these measures to protect our privacy? Personally, I think Hyatt goes a bit overboard on a few occassions (like when he recommends not using cordless phones, because someone could be listening in) but I must admit that I did take his advice by removing my Social Security Card from my wallet. I don't carry it with me anymore.<br \/>Overall, this is a pretty good book. It's a quick read, and it does give some sound advice on how to protect yourself in the information age. I wouldn't necessarily take everything Hyatt recommends to heart, but I think that some of his recommendations are worth listening to. It's better to be safe, than sorry.","images":[],"asin":"0895262878","parent_asin":"0895262878","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1009660581000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2578,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Rabbit and Snowman Become Friends","text":"The Rabbit and the Snowman is a book about friendship. The two main characters are both very lonely and each satisfies an important need present in the other. The book is also about abandonment and confusion. Snowman cannot understand why the children have left him after they built him. He starts to wonder if he doesn't look right or if his articles of clothing are not attractive. He is convinced he may never find a friend again, but then another woodland creature suddenly shows up, also in need of a friend. The two enjoy each other's company immensely, and their need to feel needed is satisfied.<br \/><br \/>Rabbit and the Snowman is a decent enough book and its message about abandonment and friendship is certainly good. But I do have some issues with this book. The main problem I have is with the characters. The book uses narration and does not offer direct quotes from either of the main characters. Because of this and because of the way the narration is conducted, these characters have little or no personality. They are a little on the dull side and because of this, you're not really sure if you care about the predicament the two characters are in because they seem too plain and boring.<br \/><br \/>The plot of this book is okay, but nothing special. It doesn't offer much imagination, but it passes and most children will find it acceptable. The main theme of the book is that abandonment and loneliness are not fun and it feels really great when one finally does find someone to share with. With this type of theme and the age group targeted, a simple story seems to work just fine and I don't think many kids will complain. The illustrations in this book are also quite colorful and nicely painted. The drawings themselves feature thin, black, speck- like lines around the edges of each object. It is almost a little too abstract for children, but adults will appreciate this artistic effort.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is decent children's book and it should be suitable enough that most children will like it. The dullness of the personalities of the two main characters is certainly a flaw, but there are enough good points in this children's book to give it a recommendation.","images":[],"asin":"1419656252","parent_asin":"1419656252","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1221185443000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2199,"length_group":3}

{"rating":3,"title":"Interesting but Limited Introduction to Edible Wild Plants","text":"I selected this book because I learned an appreciation for the outdoors from my father who did not miss a chance to point out different types of trees and leaves to me. While I can easily identify things like poison ivy and I can differentiate between red oak leaves and white oak leaves, I never really knew much about what was really edible and what to avoid. My hope was that this book would be useful to that end, and it is - to a point.<br \/><br \/>The book is a little more than just a book on wild plants you can eat. It goes into some detail on plants you must absolutely avoid, such as poison ivy\/oak\/sumac and the different species of hemlock. This section is an important addition to this book as it shows in full color what to expressly avoid.<br \/><br \/>There's a good collection of plant species in this book and each one identified has a beautiful, full-color photograph. When there is some confusion that could be made between species, it is highlighted. Some of these come with preparation instructions so that more can be done beyond just digging up the plant and eating the leaves\/root\/whatever.<br \/><br \/>There are two shortcomings of this book. First, this is a book that appears to be more regional (Eastern US) than national. Second, even for the focus area this is not a comprehensive collection. Now, with that said, it does cover the major species that can be found in that region, which makes sense based on the title - \"Quick Guide to Wild Edible Plants\", but this does not make up for the fact that a good portion of the country does not get similar coverage.<br \/><br \/>This is not a bad reference book. What is there is good material and it will definitely come in handy for the hiker or camper looking to forage.

{"rating":3,"title":"How Would You Like to Have Psychic Abilities?","text":"What would it be like to have psychic abilities? I think many among us have fantasized that we could read people's minds and predict the future. It seems like psychic abilities would be an incredible gift that would provide many benefits in everyday life and would continue to provide these benefits well into old age. After all, who wouldn't like the ability to know what others are thinking and be able to predict the future?<br \/><br \/>One man whose experience proves that the life as a psychic isn't all its cracked up to be is author Philip Chabot. He discovered his unique ability at a young age and while it did present some benefits, he quickly discovered that the life of a psychic can lead to even greater problems than benefits. His accurate predictions gave others the creeps and it led many to be fearful of him and label him as unstable. Ultimately, it landed the author in a mental hospital where he spent time with other individuals with varying degrees of psychological problems.<br \/><br \/>This book is very surreal and the author's experiences will leave many readers scratching their heads. He certainly speaks in an honest way and his personal confusion is actually what I would expect from someone who really does have psychic abilities. At first, even the author himself is perplexed. He doesn't know what is going on in his own mind. He doesn't know why he is able to hear voices and carry on conversations with people in other countries. Others cannot understand the situation either and they grow wary of this young man, ultimately sending him to a psychiatric ward to see if his problem can be cured.<br \/><br \/>Probably the best parts of this book are the author's own growth and coming of age. He spends much time by himself, in quiet reflection, wondering what he should do about these voices in his head and the problems resulting from his special abilities. I also liked how he and his father come to terms with their differences and return to a more normal coexistence. And even though the story seems far- fetched and often seems like a work of fiction, the events are told in a manner that makes them more believable.<br \/><br \/>As for cons, this book does contain a few. My greatest complaint is that the book isn't always easy to follow. It becomes most difficult when the author is including the spoken words between himself and others when he is experiencing a psychic connection. Parts of the conversation are set aside with quotation marks, and these signify the author's own words. But there is no way to tell other things apart, like actual spoken conversations vs. conversations in the author's head. It is very easy to lose track of who is saying\/thinking what and at what time.<br \/><br \/>Taken as a whole, however, this is a pretty good book about one man's struggles with his unique abilities and how they have affected his life. Having psychic abilities isn't completely far- fetched and even the CIA and other agencies recognize that some individuals do, indeed, possess these special gifts (some of the official policies of the CIA in regard to psychics are included at the start of some chapters to offer additional evidence to support the book's claims). The book ends a little more suddenly than I would like; leaving the reader wondering what happened to the book's author for the next couple of decades. But this is still an interesting, personal tale and it shows that having psychic abilities, while certainly appealing on its surface, can be a social hindrance just as much as it can be a benefit.","images":[],"asin":"0981602401","parent_asin":"0981602401","user_id":"AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ","timestamp":1224217655000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3556,"length_group":3}
{"rating":3,"title":"Vintage-Inspired Designs, Including One Dazzler","text":"A quick glance at MODERN KNITS, VINTAGE STYLE gives a totally wrong impression: that this is another spotty collection of \"modernized\" vintage knitting patterns updated for available yarns and sizing. To the contrary, MODERN KNITS, VINTAGE STYLE is a book of brand-new, modern patterns--some by well-known, currently active designers--that are merely \"inspired\" by vintage patterns.  The book's overall layout (which places the old vintage pattern photos and drawings on right-hand pages, instead of the full-color photos of the modern patterns) is completely misleading, and the subtitle (\"classic designs from the golden age of knitting\") is simply wrong.<br \/><br \/>The modern designs are somewhat uneven in quality, but there is one dazzler that justifies the book's purchase price: Franklin Habit's \"Jacqueline Bouvier Stole\".  The vintage inspiration for this beauty is a strange net stole with bouquets of artificial flowers attached at the ends.  However, the real inspiration is Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy's bouquet-covered wedding veil and dress.  Franklin has translated Jacqueline's bouquets into eyelet lace patterns that make for a truly \"inspired\" modern stole.<br \/><br \/>Other particularly attractive patterns include Anna Bell's \"Cherry Short-Sleeve Cardigan\" (with overall simple lace pattern and drawstring waist), Susan Pierce Lawrence's \"Branching Out Scarf\" (a simple but lovely lace design using mohair yarn that bears no resemblance whatever to the clumsy vintage scarf), Elanor Lynn's \"Pennant Pleated Skirt\" (fitted through waist and hips with skirt falling in easy \"pleats\", and with an added pennant stitch pattern), Betty Christiansen's \"Charming Shoulderette\" (a thoroughly modern shrug with ribbed three-quarter sleeves), and Kristin Spurkland's \"Nordic Pullover\" (a short-sleeved pullover with allover Fair Isle pattern that sheds the overly fancy, bulky long sleeves of the original design).  All of these designs incorporate considerable modern improvements over the classic designs that inspired them.

I don't disagree with folks who've opined that it could have used an editor's touch, if only to tighten it up and avoid some redundant stories.  However, it's written in Nix's own hand (and therefore in his unique Southern voice) and that's one of its main draws.  He tells his life story, along with sidebar tales involving friendships and encounters with the rich, talented, and famous, but he never comes across as a mere rock 'n' roll namedropper.  I especially like the way he sums up his Elvis adventures in Memphis: \"Looking back on those days it seems to me there were two Elvises.  The first one I saw hanging out, playing pranks, laughing, and having fun.  The other Elvis came later.  The one no one saw.

The two main characters are deeply scared and if you can get through some of extreme scenarios there is light at the end. Definitely you don't see this coming and I am trying to not give anything away but it does help cast the entire story in a new perspective. One that is good versus evil.

{"rating":4,"title":"Great Details","text":"I found it strange that a book that deals so much with a funeral home and undertakers could be so enthralling! This is my first book by Sara Blaedel. It was very fast paced and I read it all over two days. The main character, Ilka, goes to the US for the reading of her late & estranged father's will. She inherits a funeral home and all the responsibilities that go with it. The descriptions of the funeral world were pretty detailed and interesting. I didn't really care for Ilka, but I found her to be an engaging character. There is a mystery of sorts that takes place. Ilka doesn't really have anything to do with the mystery or the solving of it other than working at the funeral home. A lot of the content was a bit bland, but it was well written and I kept wanting to read it anyway.  I was disappointed that everything doesn't get wrapped up in the end and instead it ends with a &#34;to be continued&#34;.

She's a programmer and works for a tech company. One day, she gets a package, which turns out to be the ashes of her dead husband. This comes as a surprised to everyone in her daily life because no one knew she had even been married. She has to revisit feelings of grief. While there was some sad situations, it isn't a sad story.

I've been a fan since 1965 when I won a copy of The Byrds' Mr. Tambourine Man LP from NYC's WMCA Good Guys.  I have the complete Hillman discography in my collection (with a few compilation exceptions) and I've found something of value in all of them, even though there've been some missteps along the way.  Time Between recounts his family and musical life with warts and all honesty, and, perhaps even more importantly, he shares his spiritual journey and his road to contentment with the reader as well.  It's a fine ride, a journey worth taking, for sure, like a long talk with an old friend.  I'd have liked an index included for quick reference purposes, but that's a minor quibble.

She has a dysfunctional relationship with her mother. The relationship she has with her best friend is a little odd, but sweet. One of the subplots of the book involved some sexual misconduct which is very timely right now. I almost felt like it was written as a result of what's going on in the world right now, but it's merely a coincidence.

I mean, they all looked the other way! So really I have been wondering if this day would ever come and here it is. France is home to Europe's largest Jewish community.  In 2012 the murders at an Orthodox school in Toulouse, in 2015 the attack on a kosher market in a Paris suburb, a 2017 murder of a 65 year old woman, and in 2018 the murder of a Holocaust survivor are something that needs to be addressed as a whole. With the history of Europe's violence against the Jews the book points out that the powers that be and the people of France are not acting strongly enough to wipe out this rising tide of antisemitism.<br \/><br \/>It's not a perfect book, the author doesn't come off in this translation from it's original French as the most objective of writers.

I thought I would give it a shot after seeing so many positive reviews. Lady Julia Hazelton spends her days doing charitable work with war widows after her fiancé (the future earl of Worthington) died in WWI. The new earl is Cal, his lower-class mother was rejected by his father’s family, the Worthingtons, thus the revenge angle.  I thought the writing was well done but Cal never won me over.

Because she is under age she must move to New Mexico to live with her mother's sister who she never met. (right there I wish she could have a better social worker who could talk to her about emancipation options).

I've been busy, so my reading time was limited, but I made a point to carve out some reading time every day for this. The characters were well developed. They weren't too predictable. There is a lot of description and often there would be multiple paragraphs without any dialogue.I tend to gloss over those at times when I'm short on time, so there were some occasions when I had to go back and reread a little because I missed an important detail.

It's grittier, sexier, and more action-packed than the G-Rated, slightly better than your average late-'60s TV movie.  Had it actually been promoted as a television movie-of-the-week, the \"Charro!\" we know would likely have had a more positive reception (and stronger reputation); a premiere Elvis TV western back in 1969 would've been ratings gold.

I didn't like the older sister, Henri much at all. She did go through some redemption though. The younger sister, Emma, had an unhealthy obsession with her older sister that I thought was a bit weird. I have a sister and I love her, but this sisterly relationship was a bit too much. She does show so much needed growth. Alex, the boy who was trapped on the island with them was the most likeable character in my opinion. I used to fantasize about being on deserted island with a cute boy, so I found that aspect to be fun and exciting. There is a lot of alcohol use in the months before they were on the island and some sex and drug use, too, but it's not glorified.

Nevertheless, the gas grill recipes seem to work with electric just fine.<br \/><br \/>The first 47 pages cover grilling basics, gas and charcoal grills,  harnessing heat, how to read a recipe, essential techniques, etc. Page 11 is the only page that mentioned other grills such as ceramic and electric ones.<br \/><br \/>After reading the book cover to cover, I found 11 recipes that I would make. I decided to make the \"Herb Stuffed Turkey Burgers\" and added in the bacon that the recipe note said would \"take it to the next level.\" The end result was delicious. I had to grill this on my electric grill because I do not have gas or charcoal. It came out fine as can be seen in my photo.<br \/><br \/>In summary, I think this is a very good grilling book to learn the basics of grilling. I do wish he mentioned that the recipes can be followed with any type grill -- perhaps with minor modifications. Also, I would have liked some recipe photos.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81CtZIP+LiL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81CtZIP+LiL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81CtZIP+LiL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81UILwRepvL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81UILwRepvL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81UILwRepvL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81WOEoOHtDL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81WOEoOHtDL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81WOEoOHtDL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81s7paesiLL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81s7paesiLL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81s7paesiLL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1647397774","parent_asin":"1647397774","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1617565828888,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1088,"length_group":2}

After a slow start, this book quickly became hard to put down. Things basically picked up after the location change. It's a fun, romantic story set mostly in Ireland. Tara, the heroine, is a Southern belle from Charleston. Although I really did like her, I felt that some of her Southern attributes were a bit stereotyped and not realistic. The chemistry between Tara and the two men was well written and engaging. I do feel like things wrapped up a little too quickly and that the passing of time was too short. Supposedly a couple of months take place, but it came off as just a couple of weeks. Regardless, I did find it a fun, light and fluffy read.

It shows a picture of the letter on the left page and the child finds the same letter on the right page.

The story is about a 9 year old boy who lives alone with his housekeeper. His father is dead and his mother is in American trying to raise money for the family business. Although the ending was satisfying in my opinion, it left me with more questions. The book kept me engaged and guessing throughout. There are parts that seemed a little too familiar, possibly adapted or borrowed from other stories, but overall it was entertaining.","images":[],"asin":"1335652922","parent_asin":"1335652922","user_id":"AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A","timestamp":1530193592818,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":700,"length_group":2}

{"rating":4,"title":"Excellent Historical Fiction; Not Really a Mystery\/Thriller","text":"THE PARAGON HOTEL is an excellent historical novel, but it’s misclassified as a mystery\/thriller.  Yes, there’s some mystery (e.g., how did the pretty blonde white woman acquire a gunshot wound, who is she running from, where is the missing mulatto child).  But it’s really literary fiction, a serious novel that sheds light on severe racial discrimination in Portland, Oregon (and the rest of Oregon) during the early 1900s.<br \/><br \/>The “Author’s Note” at the end shares a number of shocking-to-this-reader facts about Oregon’s racist past, and about African- and Italian-Americans’ being forced to live side-by-side in poverty-stricken Harlem at the time the New York Mafia was growing powerful.  The note persuades me that author Lindsay Faye’s novel is solidly grounded in actual history, so that her novel’s events could have happened as described.<br \/><br \/>However, this isn’t the sort of escape fiction that you expect when you order a mystery\/thriller.  That said, it’s a gripping story, told well, and something of a page-turner.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see it on the New York Times best seller list after its January 2019 release.","images":[],"asin":"0735210756","parent_asin":"0735210756","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1537645557988,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1149,"length_group":2}

Much as I've always admired Neil Young's work, I have to agree with David Browne's underlying premise that his addition to the CSN mother-ship ultimately brought the ship down.  To my ears, the first album (Crosby, Stills and Nash) was near perfection; with album number two (Deja Vu) the seeds of destruction were sown.  Stills' confidence undermined by the addition of his musical brother Young; Crosby slipping deeper and deeper into his drug-induced haze; Nash unsuccessfully taking on the role of peacemaking middle child, and Young's ego being fed even as he's selfishly using the band to jump start his own solo career.  Nash's Wasted On The Way tells the tale, truly.  So many false starts, abandoned albums, unattained dreams and lost friendships.  CSNY plays out like a Greek tragedy in modern times.  Lost boys with fatal flaws who occasionally touched greatness, then immediately threw it all away.  We should be thankful for those great moments.","images":[],"asin":"0306903288","parent_asin":"0306903288","user_id":"AE7BV6IMNPZ3F266H7PXMH3BZQNQ","timestamp":1562514768594,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1075,"length_group":2}

The story is told in two different perspectives - the two best friends. The other reviews comparing it to a Mean Girls type plot are pretty accurate. There's catfishing (Cyber Bulling) and a lot of sexual reference, but there's not any actual sexual activity. One of the girls is obsessed with losing weight, hence the kale smoothie angle. I've read other books by this author and this is geared toward an older audience than the Pink & Green books. They didn't act like near seniors, but younger high school such as freshman or sophomores. There was a lot going on at times making it too busy.

The story started off slowly, but it does pick up somewhere around the middle. The main characters were described well, but some of the others who were probably introduced in the other titles, were not described enough for me which led to my confusion with them. I liked the main characters well enough, but I did feel that Liz was a little weak sometimes. The plot is a familiar one - boy falls in love with best friend's little sister,  but best friend would not approve, so the two sneak around and try to fight the feelings that they have.There's humor, romance, camping\/outdoors, and a little bit of heat.

{"rating":4,"title":"4.5 Star Read!","text":"I loved this book! My only criticism (and the reason I gave it 4.5 stars and not 5) was having to follow five different characters and their stories simultaneously made it feel very stop and start. The chapters were short and sharp and each was left on a cliffhanger (which I loved), but because you then read four other characters' stories you lose any tension and momentum built up by the time you came back around. For example, I loved Christopher's storyline but by the time I then read Nick, Mandy, Jade, and Ellie's chapters and got back to Christopher, I had almost forgotten what had happened in his story and had to go back. This was the same for Nick's who was another great character. I think one of the characters could have easily been dropped from the story to make it flow better (maybe Mandy) but overall I loved the concept of this book, the punchy writing, and I cannot wait to see what Netflix did with it!","images":[],"asin":"133521884X","parent_asin":"133521884X","user_id":"AEHWUHNTB5FX32HJ7UBOZ2WWUX3Q","timestamp":1636030026959,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"length":925,"length_group":2}

There were lots of conflicts, secrets, and misunderstandings, but things were always resolved a little too quickly. I got caught up in the story and had to force myself to put the book down and go to bed one night. I enjoyed the small town descriptions.

{"rating":4,"title":"Charles Lenox Solves \"Locked Room\" Murders on Victorian Sailing Ship","text":"British Member of Parliament (and former detective) Charles Lenox undertakes a diplomatic mission to the Suez Canal-- a mission that includes a top secret meeting of the utmost national importance with a French spy.  At stake is the English share of the profits from the newly opened canal.<br \/><br \/>To reach Egypt, Charles boards the corvette Lucy, a fast and maneuverable sailing ship that carries a crew of  220 bluejackets (regular seamen, including his young nephew Teddy) and 25 officers.  On the first night out of port, the Lucy's second lieutenant is murdered, and Charles is recruited to solve a \"locked room\" mystery that has more than 200 suspects.  Solve it he does, but only after two more men are murdered and another is almost murdered.<br \/><br \/>There are lots of surprising plot twists-- for example, when Charles discovers the true nature of his ubiquitous, hardworking, overweight, always-eating-or-snacking steward McEwan.  Even better, the narrative vividly conveys the sense of traveling on a Victorian sailing ship--not for a pleasure outing, but to reach an important business destination--by describing the officers' and sailors' daily activities, duties, and adherence to the strict chain of command.  Once Charles solves the murders, he encounters difficulties in carrying out his spying mission, so there is plenty more action (and local color) that takes place on shore in the Suez Canal region.<br \/><br \/>This classic British mystery is one of a series that features detective Charles Lenox, but it works fine as a standalone.  This was my first encounter with Charles, but I found the characters' necessary backstories to be worked seamlessly (and painlessly) into the plot.  I found the book to be thoroughly enjoyable,  although readers who are less interested in sailing ships and seafaring may find it a little slow-moving.

The world's largest skimming operation.<br \/>9. Brain is hard-wired to avoid risk even when odds of success moderately outweighs odds of failure.<br \/>10. Leveraging \"Other People's Money\" (OPM) like money saved using coupons, living on less, etc is the way to make the most money. Use 1x100 factor,so see $1 as eventually $100. investment potential - keep eye on the target.<br \/>11. So, author retired early and took 401K money and moved it to an exchange-traded index fund, he calls a \"lock box.\" As one ages, lock box will likely contain cash and CDs.<br \/>12. Lesson from Madoff - always be skeptical of any info from some self-proclaimed investment guru.<br \/>13. Use scientific method to choose stocks -observation, hypothesis, experiments and conclusions.like, observation of long lines at Coach store,, hypothesize that cause the thing observed - long lines, test hypothesis - using Yahoo Finance, Investor'sVillage, Facebook, analyst reviews - make list. Generally, smaller stocks are less covered by WS, so better opportunity to uncover things not well-known by WS. Coopetition - self-interested people have same goals, like on message boards. Wisdom of crowds. Then, verify - like using Google search, etc.<br \/>14. Use options to get leverage. 6-9 months , but a little longer when FDA approval of drugs is involved.  Slightly in-the-money options and sell before they expire if have a profit.<br \/><br \/>Overall, a fine book. The only caveat I think is that when speculating with OPM, may be too risky, maybe better to have more modest  goals using stocks of great companies which pay nice dividends, raised regularly. But, I really like his idea of looking at the world through investor's eyes, seeing saved money\/living-on-less as 100xit's actual current amount. Plus, I'd be careful using exchange traded funds since they are a new concoction, maybe better use low cost index mutual funds or just a basket of blue chip stocks which pay good dividends, raised annually - anyway I'd say be more careful with lock box money.","images":[],"asin":"0312657854","parent_asin":"0312657854","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1318459468000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3189,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Tempe in the footsteps of Longfellow...","text":"Tempe Brennan's back in her tenth mystery. For those not in the know, Dr. Temperance Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who divides her time between Qu&eacute;bec and North Carolina. No stranger to personal trouble, she's an ex-alcoholic and single mother assigned to gruesome, personally dangerous cold cases. This time, Tempe's on the trail of her vanished childhood friend &Eacute;vang&eacute;line Landry, a young Acadian who summered at Pawleys Island back when Tempe was a child. Tempe and &Eacute;vang&eacute;line would spend the summers creating poetry and staging dramas as &Eacute;vang&eacute;line shared her love of Longfellow's epic namesake poem (his &Eacute;vang&eacute;line included a romanticized account of the Acadian deportation and its aftermath). One day, &Eacute;vang&eacute;line Landry vanished without a trace, and for thirty years Tempe has longed to know what happened to her.<br \/><br \/>One of Tempe's coworkers in Qu&eacute;bec wants her to look at a skeleton uncovered in New Brunswick, and Tempe starts to put together pieces that point to &Eacute;vang&eacute;line. She is consumed with uncovering the truth behind her friend's disappearance at her own personal risk. As with previous novels, Reichs does her homework well. Acadia was an area of Eastern Canada originally settled by the French, who were later forcefully evicted by the British. Many exiled Acadians fled to Louisiana, where the name \"Acadian\" shortened to \"Cajun.\" Next to Qu&eacute;bec, New Brunswick has the largest percentage of Francophones in Canada (35% of the province is French-speaking).<br \/><br \/>Tempe's quest takes her to the small town of Tracadie-Sheila, New Brunswick. I admit, I was curious in Reichs' choice of town, because one of my favorite Francophone pop artists, Jean-François Breau, ([[ASIN:B000DZJHSI Expose]]) is from Tracadie-Sheila, as is Star Acad&eacute;mie winner [[ASIN:B0000E6EIY Wilfred Bouthillier]]. One reason I love Reichs' books is because I lived in Qu&eacute;bec and majored in Qu&eacute;bec Studies, and she effortlessly manages to work in in-the-know elements of modern Quebecois culture. No mention of Breau or Wilfred, but Garou's [[ASIN:B0000501CN Seul]] makes an appearance (in the first Temperance Brennan novel D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead, it was Roch Voisine's [[ASIN:B000NJM4M0 Helene]]).<br \/><br \/>Tempe's on-again, off-again romance with Detective Ryan is definitely off-again here. Ryan has his hands full with cold cases and personal problems, and although the two consult each other, there's precious little romantic involvement this time around. However, the vibrant cast of supporting characters fills the void.<br \/><br \/>As usual, there are dark subject matters here that may offend some, including post mortems and torture, exploitation and rape of minors, so consider yourself warned. The dialogue is witty and balanced, the pacing generally impeccable, although the ending seemed a tad rushed. Unlike some of the past few Tempe novels, I felt that this was an excellent effort that was truer in spirit to some of the first few Reichs novels. It generally doesn't stray from the realm of believability, and Reichs' expertise as a forensic anthropologist and her experiences living in Qu&eacute;bec lend Tempe an unshakable credibility.","images":[],"asin":"0743294378","parent_asin":"0743294378","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1189968046000,"helpful_vote":59,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3293,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Collection of Designer Patterns and Stories About Designers' \"Roots\"","text":"About half of this book is devoted to short, heart-warming stories about the family \"roots\" of popular knitting designers.  The remainder is devoted to designer knitting patterns \"inspired by\" the designers' grandparents, parents, and their places of origin.<br \/><br \/>Dedicated knitters will no doubt enjoy reading about the family backgrounds of Wendy Bernard, Pam Allen, Meg Swansen, Ysolda Teague, Jessica Marshall Forbes, Kay Gardiner, Joan McGowan-Michael, Kristin Spurkland, Teva Durham, Jared Flood, Norah Gaughan, Anne Hanson, Leigh Radford, Chrissy Gardiner, Adrian Bizilia, Kirsten Kapur, and Emily Johnson.<br \/><br \/>Many (but not all) of these designers contributed patterns, and there are some patterns contributed by designers who did not contribute family stories.  Most of the patterns are for small, portable projects (mittens, hats, socks, slippers, scarves, cowls, a dishcloth, a pillow), but there are some patterns for large, ambitious projects (a cardigan, a Fair Isle pullover, a cape, a lace-bordered shrug, an afghan, a lace baby blanket).  My personal favorites are Kristin Spurkland's \"Rose and Cross Pullover\" with Fair Isle yoke,  David Castillo's striped \"Conover Mittens\", Anne Hanson's \"Crocus Patch Baby Blanket\" with its complex allover lace pattern, and Cookie A.'s \"Wan Jai Socks\" that have gently undulating, street-like curves along the sock legs and feet.<br \/><br \/>The book does not include any historical \"grandmother knitting\" patterns--which was a disappointment for me.  There are no handed-down family patterns, no patterns actually knitted by or invented by the older generations of the designers'  families.  Nevertheless,  because of the entertaining, anecdotal stories and the variety of attractive patterns, I rate this book at 4 stars.  It should make a welcome gift for any serious knitter.","images":[],"asin":"1584799390","parent_asin":"1584799390","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1313902313000,"helpful_vote":20,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1846,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"5th in the series, but reads as a standalone","text":"Being a Jersey girl myself I have loved reading all 5 in the series set in Northern New Jersey between 1910 and 1920. The latest novel opens up in New Jersey but the action moves to another location Chevy Chase, Maryland, as Americans prepare for possible war and the Kopp sisters do their bit. The main characters are vividly drawn, realistic and if you have any interest in books set 100 years ago this will be enjoyable without being an information dump of facts. Only disappointment for me was not enough Constance Kopp becuase she is such a great character in the earlier books, so I hope is the focus in the next book.<br \/><br \/>Book 1 - Girl Waits with Gun Constance Kopp doesn’t quite fit the mold. She towers over most men, has no interest in marriage or domestic affairs, and has been isolated from the world since a family secret sent her and her sisters into hiding fifteen years ago. One day a belligerent and powerful silk factory owner runs down their buggy, and a dispute over damages turns into a war of bricks, bullets, and threats as he unleashes his gang on their family farm. When the sheriff enlists her help in convicting the men, Constance is forced to confront her past and defend her family — and she does it in a way that few women of 1914 would have dared.<br \/><br \/>#2 Lady Cop Makes Trouble In 1915, lady cops were not expected to chase down fugitives on the streets of New York City. But Constance Kopp never did what anyone expected. Constance and her sisters aren’t living the quiet life anymore. They’ve made headlines fighting back against a ruthless silk factory owner and his gang of thugs. After Sheriff Heath sees Constance in action, he appoints her as one of the nation’s first female deputies. But when a German-speaking con man threatens her position—and puts the honorable sheriff at risk for being thrown in his own jail—Constance will be forced to prove herself again.<br \/><br \/>#3 Miss Kopp's Midnight Confessions Constance Kopp is back—with a badge and a taste for justice. She has finally earned her deputy sheriff’s badge and is ready to tackle a new kind of case: defending independent young women brought into the Hackensack jail on dubious charges of waywardness, incorrigibility, and moral depravity. Such were the laws—and morals—of 1916. Constance uses her authority as deputy sheriff, and occasionally exceeds it, to investigate and support these women when no one else will. But it’s her sister Fleurette—who runs away from their sleepy farm to join the glamorous world of vaudeville—who puts Constance’s beliefs to the test. Is there a wayward girl in her own family?<br \/><br \/>#4 Miss Kopp Just Won't Quit After a year on the job, New Jersey’s first female deputy sheriff has collared criminals, demanded justice for wronged women, and gained notoriety nationwide for her exploits. But on one stormy night, everything falls apart.  While transporting a woman to an insane asylum, Deputy Kopp discovers something deeply troubling about her story. Before she can investigate, another inmate bound for the asylum breaks free and tries to escape.  In both cases, Constance runs instinctively toward justice. But the fall of 1916 is a high-stakes election year, and any move she makes could jeopardize Sheriff Heath’s future—and her own. Although Constance is not on the ballot, her controversial career makes her the target of political attacks.","images":[],"asin":"1328736520","parent_asin":"1328736520","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1565974579250,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3405,"length_group":3}

Ten years ago, shortly after they married, she was abducted as she hiked near their Oregon town.  She was subjected to years of horrible abuse and now she has found her way back to her husband's lovely new home and his lovely very pregnant wife, Merritt.  Luca is off looking for buyers for the restaurants he developed with Merritt in their tourist town.  They are facing serious financial difficulties.  They have a toddler daughter, a son on the way and now Lydia is there, worming her way into their lives.  Minka Kent alternates chapters from Lydia's and Merritt's perspectives as each tries to navigate the fact that Lydia is alive, here and wants something from Luca Coletti.  Lydia connects with Delphine, a shop owner in town who gives her a place to stay.  She's been homeless for awhile because Luca had her declared legally dead and she needs his help to establish her identity.  The premise of Unmissing is original and Kent's imagining of how the characters might react is well-played.  There are definitely unexpected turns and twists in a well-plotted book.

{"rating":4,"title":"Not earthshaking, but worthwhile","text":"\"Simplexity\" analyses various things and deduces how they are either simple or complex, the purpose being that we should look a little deeper into things before making consequential decisions.  Sounds like pretty much common sense, and it is to a degree, but the book does highlight some scientific insights which might help the reader in approaching some situations. Here are some items which the book presents which I think are worthwhile:<br \/><br \/>1. It is the region between order and disorder which gives complexity. For instance, a piece of copper pipe can be thought of as a simple piece of frozen solid, but it gets more complex as a network of plumbing in a skyscraper, and extremely compex at the subatomic level.<br \/><br \/>2. Any system must be seen at all levels before determining if it is complex.<br \/><br \/>3. The stock market may seem complex, but major changes in it come more from some bland pieces of information, rather than from some catastrophic news events.<br \/><br \/>4. With experiments involving how people will divide up money, they show that we \"appear to be wired for justice\".<br \/><br \/>5. Although human behavior can't be mathematized, it is influenced thusly. For example, 1.3M people die in auto accidents globally, yet something as simple as well placed speed bumps could reduce that amount quite significantly, since there is about an 80% death rate when accidents happen above 35mph.<br \/><br \/>6. Fads spread faster rather than by first influencing the most popular people first, but by first influencing a smaller number of people but those having a close relationship with the originator.<br \/><br \/>7. Politically, it is better to market ideas about a candidate which voters already think, than by breaking bigger, more surprising things. Hence, a simple approach is more effective in such situations.<br \/><br \/>8. Complicated work skills appear at some of the least prestigous jobs. For instance, truck drivers must process visual, tactile, auditory and cognitive skills all instantaneously.<br \/><br \/>9. Animals have about 1B heartbeats per lifetime, influenced by the mass of the animal. Based on that, humans should only live to age 20 or so, but they are the exception because they use their brains to \"game the system\".<br \/><br \/>10. Since humans survive by converting carbs to CO2 + H2O + energy, perhaps inorganic substances share overlapping similarities with humans since CO2 and H2O also are associated with them, like with cities compared with humans.<br \/><br \/>11. Zipf's Law - certain mathematical patterns appear as how often centain words and terms show up in text. Therefore, maybe similar patterns show up elsewhere, like income, size of corporations and urban populations. They do seem to do so.<br \/><br \/>12. \"Probability neglect\" - people seem to fear a catastophic event (terrorist attack) rather than a more chronic one (climate change) when the chronic one can cause greater harm. Apparently, there are two systems for analyzing risk, automatic (feelings) and more thoughtful (experience).<br \/><br \/>13. \"Availability heuristic\" - the better able it is to summon an image of a dangerous event, the easier it is to be afraid of it.<br \/><br \/>14. In the computer world, it has been said \"there are two kinds of people, software engineers and those who are afraid of them\".<br \/><br \/>15. Muhammad Yunnis, who pioneered microloans, showed that surgical strikes, so to speak, are more effective in reducing poverty, but that involves complex analysis.<br \/><br \/>16. The Pareto principle applies to an 80:20 rule when looking at income distribution, but also shows up in all sorts of things.<br \/><br \/>17. For the arts, complexity falls flat, but there is still a connection.  Sure, in music, but also in art, reflective of nature's quasicrystals, which have seemingly symmetric patterns though they never repeat. Jackson Pollack's paintings exhibit the mathematical concept of fractals.<br \/><br \/>So, overall, if one wants to ponder how the mind works or might work better, there are some helpful thoughts here.","images":[],"asin":"1401303013","parent_asin":"1401303013","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1216588675000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"length":4086,"length_group":3}

The book highlights the work of many women leaders. Some things I made note of from the book....<br \/><br \/>1. In October 2008 Iceland declared bankruptcy. Audur Fund was the only equity fund untouched by the financial crisis - it was managed by women. Iceland named a woman prime minister.<br \/><br \/>2. Rwanda in 2011 had the only female majority parliament in the world.<br \/><br \/>3. Women's progress (educational and political access) has been large. But, a majority of the world's women do not legally own, control, inherit property, land or wealth. And 603 million women live in countries where domestic violence is not a crime.<br \/><br \/>4.

I love the &#34;Moe Prager&#34; series, but I don't care for the premise of the &#34;Gus Murphy&#34; series, where the investigator, a retired Long Island cop, has had his comfortable life &#34;blown apart&#34; by the sudden, tragic death of his son (John Jr.).  The death ended Gus's marriage, and left him incapacitated by grief.  Now Gus conducts private investigations--reluctantly, and only for friends--while he struggles--every single day--with moving on.<br \/><br \/>This is the second &#34;Gus Murphy&#34; novel, and it works fine as a standalone.  (The first series novel, which I haven't read, is WHERE IT HURTS.  It may or may not give more details about John Jr.'s death, which apparently wasn't caused by anything that his father Gus did.)<br \/><br \/>In WHAT YOU BREAK, Gus is still working as a courtesy van driver and bar bouncer for a second-rate Long Island Hotel.  As a favor to a close friend (Father Bill), he agrees to investigate the motive behind a confessed killer's murder of the granddaughter (Linh Trang) of a thoroughly evil businessman (Micah Spears).  Then, when Gus checks out a suspicious hotel guest, who is mysteriously connected with a coworker friend (Slava), he witnesses a murder carried out by a Russian mercenary.  The ruthless mercenary is after Slava (because of a heinous crime in Slava's past), and eventually the mercenary pursues Gus as well.<br \/><br \/>The many threads of the interesting, intricate plot are handled well.  Gus's background is introduced seamlessly into the story, and Gus's crippling grief over his son's death is convincing and not particularly overdone.

{"rating":4,"title":"Well-Researched, Well-Written, Well Worth It","text":"Laura Miller's The Magician's Book: A Skeptic's Adventures in Narnia is part literary history and critique, part biography, and part memoir. She combines all of these genres wonderfully in the pursuit of one goal: to convince readers that there is more to C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia than their reduction to Christian allegory.<br \/><br \/>Miller's intentions are not entirely benign; she takes the Christian themes of Narnia very personally, and is frankly put off by them. As a self-described \"skeptic,\" she drifted away from the religion of her youth and settled on an idea of Christianity that leaves little to be desired. And yet, The Chronicles of Narnia remain the most important books of her lifetime. How can she settle the apparent discrepancy between her unbelief and her love of books so seemingly full of belief?<br \/><br \/>Miller constructs this book in three parts, which seem to mirror the progression of her own relationship with Narnia. In the first part, she articulates all the reasons to love Narnia. It's a magical place, full of talking animals, with the appeal of a secret, private garden. Children especially identify with the world of Narnia because there, children are tested and challenged, and what they do matters. There is a satisfying weight to their thoughts and actions, and in a real world typically condescending to kids, young people find Narnia liberating.<br \/><br \/>The second section of Miller's book details her discovery of the blatant Christian themes in Narnia. This was a betrayal to her, the idea of an agenda being injected into an otherwise pure reading experience. Now that C.S. Lewis the author is revealed in Narnia, she begins to realize there are other reasons not to blindly trust in the epic. Themes of racism, sexism, and elitism are apparent in the Chronicles, all stemming from Lewis' own flaws as a person. Miller is left feeling alienated and upset, until she gets some advice from author Philip Pullman, himself a detractor of Lewis and his creative worlds. Pullman tells Miller that if she is really interested in making peace with Narnia, she must find \"another way in.\"<br \/><br \/>The third section of The Magician's Book is a scholarly examination of the influences on Lewis at the time he wrote Narnia. The English landscape surrounding his home and haunts, his interest in Norse mythology and medieval romance, and especially his close relationship with fellow author J.R.R. Tolkein - all of these experiences factored in to the creation of Narnia as much as Lewis' conversion to Christianity. In finding evidence of these other crucial contributions to Narnia's universe, Miller is in essence \"reclaiming\" (as she puts it) Narnia for the readers who gain little from a Christian examination of the books.<br \/><br \/>The Magician's Book is so well-written - I was consistently impressed with Miller's thorough research and amazing ability to transition from one idea to the next. Her interviews with other authors are seamlessly woven into the path of her journey here, and I felt the contemporary views really added to my understanding. Miller doesn't require her readers to be fellow experts in the Chronicles books - she does an excellent job summarizing parts of the books under examination. The only prerequisite to enjoying Miller's effort is a love of reading, and an appreciation for the many whys and worlds involved in the creation of any given text.<br \/><br \/>Finally, While it is clear that Miller is trying to come to a heightened idea of \"full circle\" (love-hate-love Narnia), I must confess that I got caught up in the centrifugal force of the final turn. The third section was very heavy in research, and I felt it lost some of the more intimate tone of the first two sections. Still, I came away feeling that this book is an important companion to anyone's understanding and appreciation of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. I will also be enthusiastically recommending this as a book club read, since there is much opportunity for discussion, and I'm eager to pick the brains of other book lovers and new fans of Laura Miller.","images":[],"asin":"0316017639","parent_asin":"0316017639","user_id":"AGGHHNTNWUXUG2LEOP4KGUMULISQ","timestamp":1227704297000,"helpful_vote":70,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4117,"length_group":3}

We were immediately inspired to make buffalo cauiflower and it was an immediate hit. We are also excited to make eggplant lasagna once we can find decent eggplant... as well as frittatas, fritters, stuffed mushrooms.  This is great since mostly we have been french air frying sweet potatoes and potatoes and that is about it.<br \/><br \/>The cookbook itself has a number of illustrations.  I wish all recipes had quality food photography with them, and this one has some, in fact more than most I have been looking at, but still falls well short of what I would like.  But the recipes are good, I feel inspired to get a lot more out of our air fryer, and as the meat eater in the family, I am a little jealous of a lot of the Keto options. All in all it is a good cookbook, and very good for our needs.","images":[],"asin":"1250253411","parent_asin":"1250253411","user_id":"AGLQQCIS5V6EGUCS5SSNHWZHQM6Q","timestamp":1580399520540,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1164,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Basic but comprehensive guide on your workplace rights","text":"It has taken me over three weeks to read this very large guide. The text covers many topics in an easy-to-read format that every employee should be aware of with regard to their rights in the workplace.  The topics range from OSHA rules, tobacco smoke in the workplace, 401K and pension plans, privacy rights, pregnancy discrimination, medical insurance and COBRA, whistleblower laws, etc., etc.<br \/><br \/>There are some interesting case studies that the author uses to make a point.  For instance in one case study a company denied workers the use of toilet facilities.  Although the employer was following the letter of the law (providing enough facilities but not letting them use it) OSHA's official ruling on the matter stated \"Toilets that employees are not allowed to use for extended periods cannot be said to be 'available' to those employees.\"<br \/><br \/>The author also provides a list of laws by topic for each state (where applicable) which you can research further.<br \/><br \/>One thing I felt lacking in the book is an explanation of whether employees have different rights depending on living in one state and working in another.  I assume the law associated with the state they work in applies, but I am wondering if there are exceptions to this.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this guide is good for someone who is unfamiliar with their employee rights.  Many of the items covered will be familiar to those who have been in the workforce a while and, except for some nuances of the law, this book will offer just a little bit more knowledge. What I've learned more than anything else is that in many cases you'll need to get a lawyer to protect your rights.","images":[],"asin":"1413312101","parent_asin":"1413312101","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1285636462000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1665,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"Not the Story You Would Expect It to Be","text":"This book shows the power of not following the standard script in your life.  When finding out that her husband was having a relationship crisis, it would have been easier to over react and end the marriage.  That is such a typical response that I was amazed when she did not. It went against all expectations when she pulled back and realized she was in charge of her reactions to her husband.  I can't even say that I agreed with her decision to  just help her husband by just carrying on with their life.<br \/><br \/>Munson has a good writing style which seems like a conversation with a close friend.  Her visuals made me feel like I was in her Montana home at her neatly set table.  The writing just put me there.  Where many memoirs are overly sad or strive too hard to be ironically funny in every line, this book seemed like a visit with an old friend, talking about what happened in the years apart.  I just wish we were given more of the happy times after the crisis.  Her husband did come around, but I would feel more comfortable if I felt they were on a very good footing.<br \/><br \/>The basis of the author's memoir seems very similar to a message Eleanor Roosevelt had (and I am paraphrasing badly.) You are in charge of your own happiness and how you react to situations.  This is a perfect book club book, it deals positively with universal relationship issue and would stimulate a lot of conversation.","images":[],"asin":"0399156658","parent_asin":"0399156658","user_id":"AGLQQCIS5V6EGUCS5SSNHWZHQM6Q","timestamp":1272172465000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1418,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"A lovely, easy-to-play book full of classics","text":"I fell madly in love with Rod Stewart's Great American Songbook albums, which led me to discover other classic standards by Kern, Porter, Gershwin, Berlin, and others, and I was looking for a relatively simple, yet soulful, piano adaptation for solo piano.<br \/><br \/>The portfolio contains fifteen songs from the first two albums [[ASIN:B00006JL4J It Had to Be You...

Note that these are the original versions of the songs, complete with intros that were not recorded by Rod and transcriptions in different keys, so if all you're familiar with are the CD versions, then this will be a bit of a letdown.<br \/><br \/>However, it was exactly what I was looking for; I would label this as low intermediate, with a short learning curve, and the songs are gentle, slow, romantic and jazzy, the kind of background music you'd expect in a romantic restaurant. There are no flashy pyrotechnics or harsh chords, only simple, slow melodies that evoke a simpler time. This is perfect for a beginning piano student, provided that you have a bit of patience.<br \/><br \/>Bookwise, this is bare bones, with no photos and a scant 63 pages, but if you're a fan of the Great American Songbook, this is a very doable introduction to timeless songs that our parents \/ grandparents grew up with.","images":[],"asin":"0634073273","parent_asin":"0634073273","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1211716688000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1514,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"Private Consultant With Weaponized Mental Gift Solves Special Problems for Super-Wealthy People","text":"KILLFILE is an excellent, well-written thriller, with a fantasy element.  The hero, John Smith (that's his real name--he was a foster child, and was christened by a social worker), is gifted\/cursed with the ability to hear other people's thoughts.  When he joined the army, his gift came to the CIA's attention, and the CIA co-opted him and weaponized the gift (think Sookie Stackhouse with Special Forces training).  Now Smith is no longer with the CIA.  He's an independent contractor who solves big problems for the super-wealthy, the kind of problems that cannot be solved by the standard remedies (e.g., police and the court system).<br \/><br \/>In the novel, Smith is hired by a billionaire stock market analyst (Sloan) who has developed an algorithm that predicts stock movement.  One of Sloane's former employees (Preston) has stolen the algorithm, adapted it for &#34;data-mining&#34;, and started his own company (OmniVore).  OmniVore is about to go public, and Sloan wants his algorithm back.  So Smith's assignment is simple:  steal the algorithm from OmniVore, wipe  all traces of the algorithm from OminiVore's computers, and--just to make sure--wipe the algorithm file from Preston's brain.  (Yes, it's possible that Smith may be able to wipe someone's brain.)<br \/><br \/>As Smith's fee, Sloan is offering a remote island with all the modern conveniences, but totally without people--so that Smith can experience peace and quiet, without having to listen to the boring, noisy thoughts of everyone around him.  The reward is just too tempting--so Smith accepts the job.  Sloan also assigns a gorgeous, brainy, female assistant (Foster) to ensure that Smith has everything he needs (e.g., credit cards, plane tickets, dossiers on Preston) to carry out the job.  Foster arranges for Smith to meet Preston at an OmniVore employee retreat at a mountain hunting lodge, and--almost immediately--the whole operation goes sideways.  Smith and Foster go on the run, Preston issues kill-on-sight orders, and Smith and Foster must go off the grid until they can formulate a plan to complete their assignment.<br \/><br \/>KILLFILE relies heavily on a single trick--Smith's ability to defend himself by reading attackers' thoughts and countering their murderous actions with his own actions or thoughts.  Because of this, the otherwise interesting plot becomes a bit repetitive and predictable.  Also, the plot sometimes skips forward, without explaining exactly how Smith extricated himself from a dangerous situation (e.g., how he escaped from the grounds of a well-guarded hunting lodge and game preserve).  This happens when Smith lands in a dangerous spot where his mind control gift won't help.<br \/><br \/>Because KILLFILE is a fast, entertaining read, but a little bit flawed in concept and execution, I rate it at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"0062416405","parent_asin":"0062416405","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1460768646000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2880,"length_group":3}

So when she returns home to London from the French warfront on Christmas leave, and finds a battered wife with a concussion in the doorway of her flat, Bess quite naturally agrees to accompany the injured woman to Sussex to ensure her safe return to her family.  After arriving in Sussex, Bess accidentally learns some dark family secrets, and her already delayed Christmas visit to her parents in Somerset is further delayed by the murder of a houseguest in Sussex.  Ultimately, Bess is charged with a virtually impossible task to accomplish upon her return to wartime France:  locating an orphaned French child who may be the love child of the army officer husband of the battered wife.<br \/><br \/>A BITTER TRUTH is the third book in Charles Todd's \"Bess Crawford\" series.  The story unfolds in a leisurely fashion, the murders are civilized (without gory descriptive details), and the backdrop of WWI England is well drawn.  Author Charles Todd (a mother and son team) writes extremely well, and has a wonderful knowledge of the WWI period that is incorporated in all of the Todd mystery novels.  Even when the plots, like this one, are a little far-fetched, Todd holds the reader's interest and wraps everything up in a believable fashion.<br \/><br \/>A BITTER TRUTH is a little bit lighter on the WWI historical detail than usual, so I was a little disappointed.  This novel works fine as a standalone, but I would still recommend that readers new to the series begin with the first \"Bess Crawford\" novel, [[ASIN:B003JTHR6O A Duty to the Dead]], in order to better understand Bess' situation and her particular family relationships with her mother, the Colonel Sahib, and Simon Brandon.","images":[],"asin":"0062015702","parent_asin":"0062015702","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1330910992000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1763,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"One man's exploits searching and protecting bats -- TEXT ONLY and NO PICTURES","text":"When I was 12, I saw my first bat &#34;sleeping&#34; on a box in the barn at a camp I was staying at. Despite the negative things I heard about bats, I just fell in love from a distance and always wanted to hold one. I have never seen another bat nor have I held one. As with my fascination, this book reminds me of one boy's fascination with bats that has turned into a lifelong career.  The author is addicted to finding them, photographing them, and advocating for them. Each chapter is a different story of his exploits. I honestly don't know how this scientist is alive today as he's gotten himself into many precarious predicaments such as getting his vehicle stuck in quicksand, temporarily losing major lung capacity as a result of an ammonia-filled cave, etc.<br \/><br \/>I enjoyed all his escapades and the lengths he would go to in finding elusive and not-so-elusive bats. Although, this text is a little educational with some tiny bat facts it is really more like the author's trip diary told in an engaging manner.<br \/><br \/>One serious flaw is that there is not even a single picture or centerfold of photos in the entire book. He talks so much about the extreme difficulty of photographing some bats for National Geographic and how beautiful they are that I wanted to see them. The only photo is the un-captioned cover picture but I have no idea what kind of bat it is.<br \/><br \/>Most pre-release books will have blank pages where photos are going to be printed. Therefore, I suspect no photos will be included in the final edition because no such pages exist in my pre-release copy. I think that is a shame because I wanted to view at least one picture of each bat he went searching for and found. This is my only disappointment with this otherwise enjoyable book.","images":[],"asin":"0544382277","parent_asin":"0544382277","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1442020692000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1781,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"To Be Swallowed","text":"I recently ate dinner at a tiny Italian restaurant in San Francisco.  Highly recommended by local residents, the place had a simple charm that was at the same time both inviting and slightly foreign. I ordered the roasted chicken with potatoes, and marveled at how delicious the food was. There was no fancy sauce over the chicken or even an extravagant garnish to dress the plate. Just roasted chicken with a hint of rosemary, and soft, delectable potatoes on the side. I could taste the purity of the food, and was left utterly satisfied, without the feeling of gluttony or eater's remorse.<br \/><br \/>I make the analogy of food with this website, and so I extend the analogy of this wonderful meal to my review of Kat Ricker's book of poems and short stories, Something Familiar. There is certainly something in this book for everyone - a bit of fantasy, a sample of memory, quiet humor, and even a story \"based on actual hearsay.\" It is a small, simple, appealing, rich, wonderfully executed collection of writing.<br \/><br \/>The title is entirely appropriate, for what I see as two distinct reasons. On one hand, I believe readers will find something in the stories and poems that is familiar to themselves. In \"Ray's Foul Ball,\" I saw myself as a parent in the juxtaposition of Ray's own individual dreams versus his selfless love for his daughter. In \"Remembering Mrs. Little,\" I saw myself on Mrs. Little's bed, pouring out her tin of buttons (only, in my memory, they are my grandmother's buttons, passed down through generations). And even in the fantastical \"The Secret of Lara Lee,\" I know what it's like to have \"something click\" and to understand Lara Lee's declaration \"Isn't it good just to be!\"<br \/><br \/>The other incarnation of the title is the way in which many of Ricker's characters, when faced with the circumstances of a changing life, retreat to something familiar in their own lives, or in their past. Oftentimes, you can even see it in their eyes. In \"Change of Venue,\" the artisan, faced with harsh financial realities, must turn to different pursuits, and yet you know the \"truth - eyes sparkled\" of where he would rather be. Old Michael's bent form is transformed in \"Walnut Harvest in Newberg,\" as he remembers his fine accomplishments and \"his eyes dawned\" through the recollection. And despite Mattie's confused behavior in \"Mattie's Orchids,\" something of her former self slips through when \"from the blankets, she turns and winks at you, twinkle of mischief in her eye.\"<br \/><br \/>The flowing theme throughout this book of \"something familiar\" is rounded out by some wonderful phrasing in the poems and stories. In fact, in some cases as I was reading, the title could have just as easily have been something *unexpected,* as Ricker puts images together in beautiful new forms. There are also moments of humor that gratefully caught me off guard. I really enjoyed this smooth book, served up with little flair, relying instead on its own, unpolished beauty to deliver an exceptional reading experience.","images":[],"asin":"1590281527","parent_asin":"1590281527","user_id":"AGGHHNTNWUXUG2LEOP4KGUMULISQ","timestamp":1177428201000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3039,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Perfect for those new to crafting, including children with adult supervision","text":"This book dabbles in a little bit of everything related to crafts. Although the focus is mostly on crafting with materials that can be re-purposed from the wild or that you can grow yourself, there are other recipes related to using items in your pantry.<br \/><br \/>In 194 pages, the author discusses how to create a fairy garden, make a simple jam, work with pine cones, create natural dyes, grow certain foods such as beets, create lotions from items purchased in the grocery isle, knit a slouch hat with a circle loom, concoct a rosewater face toner, etc.  Most items are simple and some other items are extremely simple, like making vanilla or cinnamon sugar.  Since I already made vanilla sugar before, I made cinnamon sugar using her recipe which came out great. Cinnamon sugar is delicious on buttered toast.  I can see myself one day making the “beach-in-a-jar coconut whip” or “Amy’s red, white, and blue jam.”<br \/><br \/>I read through many of the recipes and the caveats of each. For instance, in the recipe for the mango, coconut and beeswax lotion bars, she warns the crafter not to boil the mixture or it could explode.<br \/><br \/>Although, the intro to each craft provides some good information, what I would have liked is some mention of whether the lotion and potion recipes can be mixed using my kitchen bowls that I use for food. I am wondering if I have to re-purpose some kitchen implements for just these tasks and retire them from food service.  I refrained from trying those recipes because I do not have (nor do I want) a second set of kitchen tools and mixers dedicated solely to these recipes.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this is a small crafting book with such varied craft ideas that there are sure to be two or more items that a beginner crafter (like me) will find useful. It does not go in-depth on anything but instead provides a smattering of suggestions on how to craft with nature and with items from your pantry. This, however, does not mean that the crafts will be &#34;free.&#34;  Purchases will have to be made for many of the items being crafted—such as a circle loom for creating a slouch hat, scented oils for the lotions, etc.","images":[],"asin":"1624141986","parent_asin":"1624141986","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1459212307000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2165,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Long-Time Baseball Fans May Identify With Serial Killer Enraged by Inflated Ticket Prices, Outrageous Player Salaries","text":"Like the first book in this series ([[ASIN:0533164699 Splattered Blood]]), THREE STRIKES AND YOU'RE DEAD departs from the usual mystery\/thriller formula by featuring a crime-solving team instead of a single hero\/heroine.  In this outing, Randy Larkin, Roseanne Kelly, and Graham Dunne have joined forces with a semi-retired private investigator (Pete Peterson) in order to acquire the supervised hours they need to qualify for their own private investigators' licenses.<br \/><br \/>But they've hardly logged any supervised time before a baseball strike turns a rabid fan into a serial killer (the Vindicator) who targets baseball's biggest stars--the \"greediest\" players who earn the most outrageous salaries.  The killer blames the players for raising ticket prices so that genuine, ordinary baseball fans can no longer afford to attend games.  After the first murder--an All-Star player who has just signed with a new, higher-bidding team is electrocuted in a San Antonio hotel room--the FBI, local police, and the baseball commissioner are completely baffled.  So when the resourceful Roseanne offers the investigative team's services, pointing out that their firm specializes in sports-related crime and recently solved the Boston Celtics case, the commissioner hires them as \"fresh eyes\".<br \/><br \/>If you're a long-time baseball fan, the story is particularly entertaining.  What true fan doesn't hate free agency and striking baseball players?  But most fans won't stay sympathetic to the Vindicator for long, because he targets good-guy baseball stars right along with the truly greedy ones who only play for money and what it will buy them.  The plot includes three well-designed murders that keep the story interesting, and everything hangs together well.  This series entry continues the development of Rosanne and Randy's relationship, and introduces their curmudgeonly, intriguing, slightly comical supervisor Pete.<br \/><br \/>The novel isn't a rip-roaring  page-turner, but it's a fast, enjoyable read.  My only complaint is that Randy spends a little too much time reflecting on current events (in a way that doesn't really advance the plot) for my taste.  For that reason, I rate THREE STRIKES AND YOU'RE DEAD at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1499049307","parent_asin":"1499049307","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1418345389000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2280,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Cat dives into culture and romance in \"Heart and Salsa\"","text":"Cat Wilcox ditches frozen Boston for tropical Oaxaca, Mexico in order to escape her new stepdad and her happier memories of her life in Arizona as a regional diving champ. There, she hopes to spend all summer bonding with her best friend Sabrina, but when she arrives at the airport, Sabrina has more than her luggage in tow: she's madly in love with her new boyfriend Brian, who's also in the S.A.S.S. (Students Across the Seven Seas) program.<br \/><br \/>Cat and the others work to build an orphanage for needy Oaxacan children, and they're also expected to pick up Spanish (there are no formal language classes) and Mexican culture and history through educational field trips. Cat's host family seems nice enough, if you discount the prickly teenage daughter Itzel, Cat's new roommate. Itzel seems determined to show up Cat as yet another spoiled rich American princess.<br \/><br \/>Cat's summer doesn't turn out quite like she'd planned; the timid Cat is terrified of boys, and when classmate Aiden (a successful competitive swimmer) approaches her, she's petrified. Through Aiden, Cat learns that change is inevitable; her life in Boston will never be the same as in Scottsdale, and she slowly opens up to the new possibilities that life in Boston with her new stepfather holds.<br \/><br \/>She embraces real Mexican culture (including some adventuresome, albeit unintentional, food choices) and her Spanish improves dramatically, as does her rocky relationship with Izzie. Her summer in Mexico changes her for the better, making her realize how lucky she is to have three great parents where the Oaxacan orphans, so grateful for a new home, have none.<br \/><br \/>Suzanne Nelson has filled the novel with many elements of Mexican culture, from historical tidbits about pre-Columbian and colonial cities to folk art, regional cuisine, and flora and fauna that really serve to immerse the reader into Oaxaca and Mexico in general (although some of the Spanish translations were a little suspect). This is a fun read that focuses on friendship, the meaning of family, and learning to see the world through new eyes.","images":[],"asin":"0142406473","parent_asin":"0142406473","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1243711930000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2114,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Pretty Ornaments Knitted in Red & White","text":"This is a nice pattern book, but the \"colorful festive ornaments\" subtitle is a bit misleading. With few exceptions, the photos show Christmas balls that are knitted in just two \"colors\": red & white, red & silver, or black & white. Some photos show balls that have colored sequins attached. The authors explain that they use red & white because that combination looks best against a green Christmas tree. Of course, knitters can knit the balls in multiple colors, but there is only one example: \"Tricolor\", shown on the book jacket cover at the top.<br \/><br \/>There is one basic, easy-to-knit pattern for the balls. You knit a tube, starting with a few stitches, then increase and decrease to get the ball shape, and end once again with only a few stitches. The ball is stuffed, the tube is sewn closed, and the yarn ends are crocheted into a hanging loop. Detailed instructions are given for crocheting the hanging loops, but non-crocheters could certainly use wire hangers.<br \/><br \/>The ball designs are added by \"knitting in\", using Fair Isle technique; or by embroidering, using duplicate stitch technique. The duplicate stitch method is clearly illustrated. However, the \"knitting in\" method is only vaguely discussed. Knitters who are unfamiliar with color knitting will need to consult something else (to learn about charts, floats, tension, and handling two yarns) if they want to \"knit in\" the designs.<br \/><br \/>The book has clear, easy-to-read charts for a wide variety of simple motifs: geometric patterns, snowflakes, Norwegian roses, stick-figure skiers and dancers, hearts, anchors, reindeer, flowers, birds. Many of the motifs are taken from, or inspired by, traditional Norwegian knitted sweaters, hats, and mittens.<br \/><br \/>There are many photos of ornate traditional Norwegian Christmas ornaments (handmade from wood or glass), printed holiday books and cards, and holiday decorations (including a miniature dollhouse).  However, there are no instructions for knitted centerpieces, wreaths, or window dressings (as I expected from the subtitle).  Because of the excellent charts, but lack of examples of multi-colored Christmas balls, I rate this book at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1570764875","parent_asin":"1570764875","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1309288476000,"helpful_vote":21,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2233,"length_group":3}

LETTING GO is an engaging account of how she made that decision, the surprising challenges she faced, the unanticipated journey that ensued, and the good life that followed. LETTING GO speaks to universal themes: transforming family dynamics as the older generation cedes power to the younger; thriving as a woman in an era of changing gender roles; facing aging and staying vital while no longer climbing the career ladder. Contrary to the “having it all” mind set, Sokol Blosser’s story proves that LETTING GO can be the most fulfilling life choice.<br \/><br \/>2008 [[ASIN:0615206387 Gracious & Ruthless: Surprising Strategies for Business Success]]<br \/>A small book with large ideas, Gracious & Ruthless gives advice on running a successful business while staying true to your values.

By the book’s final pages, she has become president of Sokol Blosser Winery, widely respected for gaining national visibility and for producing world-class wines, especially the elusive Pinot Noir. Along the way, Sokol Blosser tells how she learned to do everything from driving a tractor and managing a picking crew to selling Oregon wine in Manhattan. She also shares some special accomplishments: how she instituted values of environmental sustainability and social responsibility at the vineyard, integrated family and business life, and successfully brought the second generation on board.This moving, evocative memoir, woven with lyrical descriptions of the sights and smells of vineyard life, tells the inspirational story of one woman's journey to success in an industry run mostly by men. At Home in the Vineyard, filled with colorful characters and unexpected experiences, brings a local rural community vividly alive as Oregon wine pioneer and industry icon Susan Sokol Blosser recounts how she fell in love with a vineyard, learned how to run it, and ultimately achieved her vision of producing Pinot Noirs to rival those of Burgundy. An intimate family story, At Home in the Vineyard also gives a candid insider's view of Oregon's flourishing wine industry.","images":[],"asin":"1513260715","parent_asin":"1513260715","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1508456015795,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3663,"length_group":3}

In her spare time, she loves all-night shopping at Wal-Mart, learning how to salsa and surf, and studying design. So far, so good, right? Except for the fact that Cesca's a vampire who hates the smell of blood (it literally makes her sick), goes out during the daytime if the sun's not too strong, doesn't use her vamp powers, and she's on the prowl for Mr. Right. After being buried for most of her (undead) life, she's determined to live her life to the fullest. As a vampire, she's required to wear a tracking chip and to have a human sponsor, but other than these small inconveniences, her life is pretty normal. Like Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire novels, there is a violent anti-vampire group, the Covenant, that seeks to find and destroy vamps.<br \/><br \/>Cesca is a refreshing narrator; a psychic, her take-no-prisoners attitude is tested when she's involved in a murder investigation; special investigator Deke Saber rubs her the wrong way. Cesca's never been romantically involved, and Deke starts to get on her nerves in other ways that she didn't expect. Cesca starts to resent all the happy couples that surround her and fears that she'll be single forever, but fate has other plans.<br \/><br \/>Things get weirder for Cesca as the same tourists appear for repeat ghost tours (and yes, ghosts do make appearances), and a mysterious magical cat follows her around.

Wayne Pacelle makes it very clear from the start that this text is all about our contradictory impulses toward animals--on one hand we love them and on the other we kill and mistreat them.<br \/><br \/>He discusses:<br \/>- The Michael Vick case and his association with him<br \/>- Dog fighting<br \/>- Cock fighting<br \/>- Animals as pets<br \/>- The lengths some will go through to protect animals<br \/>- Some animal welfare agencies<br \/>- The wild animal trade<br \/>- The sealers<br \/>- Yearly pigeon shoots in Pennsylvania<br \/>- Where many museum specimens come from<br \/>- The economics associated with livestock and farm animals as food<br \/>- The two-faced way some of our forest rangers claim to protect the natural wildlife of the park and then at the same time coral buffalo or other animals for a legalized hunt, etc.<br \/>- How the American Veterinary Medical Association allows some abhorrent practices to take place.<br \/>- How agencies that are really pro-cruelty and pro-kill disguise themselves under animal welfare type names. For instance, the rodeo people and horse slaughter folks call themselves the Animal Welfare League; the bear baiters call themselves Maine Fish and Wildlife Conservation Council; and the California factory farmers who perpetuate animal abuse in the food industry are known as Californians for SAFE Food.<br \/>- etc., etc., etc.<br \/>- He closes with 50 ways to help animals<br \/><br \/>Wayne Pacelle goes into great detail about all these industries, associations and groups. He educates the reader in a non-condescending way by supplying many facts to support his arguments and clearly articulating a solution.  This book is exceptional for the true animal lover and for those who want to lessen the cruelty that still exists even though we don't personally see it.  Part of his message is not to stop eating animals but to reduce our consumption and choose to support farmers who allow their animals destined for slaughter to at least live before they die.<br \/><br \/>He knows that humans will ALWAYS have an impact on animals and that animals die for us even if we are vegetarians--it is really unavoidable but it also goes unseen.  In this book he teaches us that we have a choice to lessen that impact.<br \/><br \/>The subject matter, detail, and the way this story is written are five-star quality.  Only the first chapter is two stars because his attempt to elaborate on why we have a bond with animals and the history of that bond was not compelling to me and I thought this chapter detracted from the true message of this book nor did it add any value.  Despite this, Wayne Pacelle has written a book I would have loved to been able to write myself.<br \/><br \/>This quote, to me, should make everyone think --> \"Human ingenuity has a way of outrunning human conscience, and some things we do only because we can--forgetting to ask whether we should.\"","images":[],"asin":"0061969788","parent_asin":"0061969788","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1302310813000,"helpful_vote":13,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3371,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"A nice companion piece to the French and Italian Slow Cooker books; shines for desserts","text":"I own both of Michele's [[ASIN:054700303X The Italian Slow Cooker]] and [[ASIN:0547508042 The French Slow Cooker]] books, and they are in frequent rotation in my [[ASIN:B0026A7GRM Hamilton Beach Premiere Cookware 5-1\/2-Quart Slow Cooker]] for their winning combination of authentic flavors and relatively easy prep.<br \/><br \/>I preordered her latest, Mediterranean Slow Cooker, and quickly bookmarked several recipes that caught my eye. In the French Slow Cooker, Michele demystified soufflés for the slow cooker. Here, you'll find a variety of egg dishes like spinach and feta omelet, spicy vegetable eggah, Israeli breakfast favorite shakshouka, and a delicate green bean and scallion torta that would all make fantastic brunch options.<br \/><br \/>The poached salmon in court-bouillon was a winner, especially when paired with the suggested tzatziki, and the shrimp with tomatoes and feta (my personal preference was to switch out the white wine in the sauce for red) was also a favorite. The crunchy mustard chicken diable has the ingenious solution of slow-cooking bone-in chicken thighs, then toasting panko on the stove and coating the chicken at the last minute so the topping remains crunchy (this would make a great picnic dish!). And the pork ragu with broken lasagna Maialino-style was an unexpected gem; the simple sauce is served over irregular sheets of lasagna noodles tossed with Parmigiano and arugula. Fans of lamb will find plenty to rejoice over, including numerous Greek recipes like Bandits' Lamb (stuffed with salty Greek cheese) and Middle Eastern lamb and pine nut meatballs.<br \/><br \/>Vegetarians will also find some offerings, such as red lentil soup, winter squash and chickpea soup, polenta with herbs, wheat berry tabbouleh, bulgur and toasted walnut pilaf, and farro with spring vegetables. Like her other slow cooker cookbooks, you'll also find \"out of the pot\" recipes that use precooked beans, etc.; here these offerings include a Greek country chickpea salad, hummus, and Turkish beet and goat cheese dip.<br \/><br \/>For me, the real star of the book was the desserts. The entire section is crammed full of intriguing finds, like several Greek-inspired cakes (sunny orange cake with orange syrup, walnut cake with cinnamon syrup), decadent cheesecakes (the first recipe I tried was the awesome cannoli cheesecake; see above for a photo) including Nutella, several flans, bread puddings, and fruit (blushing pomegranate pears, warm fruit compote with mascarpone sauce).<br \/><br \/>This is a worthy investment if you enjoy Italian, Spanish, and Greek food, and most of the ingredients should be easy to find at your local supermarket. Yes, there is some prep involved in the chopping and sautéing of veggies (and browning of meat) before cooking, but this adds a wealth of flavor to the final dish that is well worth the extra time (and if you have a slow cooker with a metal insert, you can sauté and cook in the same dish). The desserts alone are worth the cost of the book; Michele taught me that I can make showstopping cheesecakes in my slow cooker, a trick I never would have thought to try on my own! (I used [[ASIN:B000237FS0 Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch]] set on a [[ASIN:B005FPD6VA Spice Ratchet 16812 Blossom Multi-Use Silicone Trivet, Black]]).<br \/><br \/>**Update 1\/20: In addition to the cannoli cheesecake, I've also made the sunny orange cake with orange syrup (which is basically a revani or basbousa, in this case lightened by folding in whipped egg whites), coffee flan, and the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake (see photos above). Maybe it's just my particular slow cooker, but I found that my cakes baked much more quickly than the suggested times, so check at least 30 minutes before the book times to play it safe.<br \/><br \/>***Update 5\/26: I have also tried the roasted beets and beet and goat cheese dip, basic recipe for chickpeas and the country chickpea salad and hummus, and next up is the coconut flan (everybody RAVES about the coffee caramel flan, so I wanted to try the variation!). I have enjoyed every dish I've tried from the Mediterranean Slow Cooker!","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61KF5pprJ+L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61KF5pprJ+L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61KF5pprJ+L._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61W5nm67SWL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61W5nm67SWL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61W5nm67SWL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61dI1OkpYrL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61dI1OkpYrL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61dI1OkpYrL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61gGKyPIbaL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61gGKyPIbaL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61gGKyPIbaL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"0547744455","parent_asin":"0547744455","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1358472683000,"helpful_vote":111,"verified_purchase":true,"length":4137,"length_group":3}

However the dialogue was LOL dementedly funny.  Her first book 'Shine, Shine, Shine' sounded like a white hot mess: a pregnant woman suffering with alopecia, her astronaut husband in outer space, their autistic son, and her mother, who is dying from cancer' if her name was Job that would make sense. So I was wary of ordering this title, but took the plunge after reading many positive reviews (and the title grabbed attention). So, I am now ordering the title the NY Times called a &#34;stellar, thought-provoking debut.&#34;  Her 2012 column &#34;15-ways-to-stay-married-for-15-years&#34; was very entertaining.<br \/><br \/>In this novel, 29 year old Irene Sparks is an uptight genius not attracted to her boyfriend. 29 year old genius George Dermont, is catnip to every female scientist he meets.

{"rating":4,"title":"A delightful treasure trove of Christmas cheer","text":"I discovered Debbie Macomber through her [[ASIN:0373892136 Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove Cookbook]], which was in our small local library in Central Japan. After returning home from six months with no kitchen (and having spent the previous Christmas overseas), I was thrilled to see her Christmas cookbook, and made numerous dishes from it for my first Christmas back home with family and friends, including the three-cheese scalloped potatoes and numerous sweets (triple ginger chocolate chunk cookies, almond joy to the world, cappuccino snickerdoodles with mocha glaze). The only real miss was the scalloped potatoes, which turned out far too watery. The recipe calls for 3 cups whole milk but no flour or other thickener, and the starch from the potatoes wasn't enough to hold it together (the milk is simply heated before being poured over the potatoes and baked).<br \/><br \/>The recipes include traditional favorites alongside international additions like Spanish tortilla, green pea hummus, Provencal tomatoes, and tzatziki dip, so you can mix and match influences if you so desire. Tucked between the recipes you'll find cute, easy decorating ideas and crafts. If you could wrap up the sights, smells, and tastes of everything wonderful about holiday season, it would look a lot like this! \"Debbie Macomber's Christmas\" would make a wonderful gift for family and friends, and it's also a great cookbook to cook from together as a family (some of the simpler recipes would be appropriate for young kitchen helpers).","images":[],"asin":"037389239X","parent_asin":"037389239X","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1351339311000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1521,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"A great companion to \"Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker\"","text":"I first heard of Robin Robertson from her yuba-wrapped vegetarian haggis in [[ASIN:1558322566 Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker: 200 Recipes for Healthy and Hearty One-Pot Meals That Are Ready When You Are]]. Now Robin has released a slow-cooker book catering to vegans, but you certainly don't have to be vegan (or even vegetarian!) to enjoy it. You'll find many surprising and tasty international influences within, like Vietnamese pho, three-bean cholent, Moroccan tempeh and chickpeas with prunes and apricots, French cassoulets, Greek beans, Latin updates (chimichurri spaghetti squash, layered tamale pie, seitan ropa vieja) and even a touch of soul food.<br \/><br \/>If you're new to slow cookers, you'll find a handy chapter on slow cooker basics, including crockery care caveats (say that three times fast!), slow cooker points and pointers, tips for slow-cooking success, timing factors, and an in-depth look at ingredients (beans, packaged meat alternatives, vegan thickeners, etc.). Recipes are labeled whether there is a gluten- and\/or soy-free option; however, no nutritional info is provided.<br \/><br \/>Like her previous slow-cooker book (and those by other authors like Michele Scicolone), you will find many recipes that recommend sauteeing veggies and\/or spices in a skillet before adding them to the slow cooker. Yes, this results in extra pots and pans and prep time, but it adds a whole other layer of flavor to the finished dish.<br \/><br \/>I tried several dishes, including the layered tapenade potatoes, slow-cooker pho, and the pi&ntilde;a colada cake (which I baked up in muffin tins instead of cake form).<br \/><br \/>*The layered tapenade potatoes had a great depth of flavor from the combination of the olives (I used kalamata instead of green), sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts and capers; this would be good on its own as a dip. I like lots of crunchy topping, so I added extra toasted panko (the recipe only calls for 3 tablespoons).<br \/><br \/>* The pho had a rich, spicy broth made with whole star anise and cloves (I used [[ASIN:B0006SYA3E Bouquet Garni Bags]] for easier removal). I also used a different kind of miso that I had on hand. This would make a great breakfast soup on its own without the rice noodles, much like miso is served in Japan.<br \/><br \/>*Finally, I tried the pi&ntilde;a colada cake, which is rich with three types of coconut (shredded unsweetened, coconut extract, and cream of coconut), a splash of dark rum, and pineapple chunks and juice. These baked up super-moist, and I added additional shredded coconut after applying the glaze.<br \/><br \/>One thing to note: the bean recipes call for precooked beans, either canned or homemade, so make sure you have some form of cooked beans on hand before starting the recipes. One of the few recipes that calls for dried beans is the three-bean cholent, which has a recommended cooking time of 8 to 11.5 hours or overnight.<br \/><br \/>I've already bookmarked many other recipes to try (the ribollita is next on my list). I particularly liked the breakfast and dessert chapters, which feature cakes, bread pudding, and breads. The hot sangria from the hot drinks chapter will also be in frequent rotation, and you'll find plenty of appetizing nibbles to serve with the various punches (spiced rum punch, celebration punch, blushing spiced cider). There is sufficient variety and dishes to suit every taste to keep you happily coming back to Fresh from the Vegan Slow Cooker.","images":[],"asin":"1558327908","parent_asin":"1558327908","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1354487931000,"helpful_vote":18,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3484,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"A nice addition to \"Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day,\" but not as versatile","text":"When [[ASIN:0312362919 Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking]] first came out, it revolutionized my bread baking. Before, I would use my Cuisinart bread machine once or twice a month, but with \"Artisan Bread in 5,\" I would bake at least once a week using the book's no-knead method to produce brioche, challah, and caramel pecan rolls that rivaled those from my local bakery. When the sequel [[ASIN:0312545525 Healthy Bread in Five Minutes a Day: 100 New Recipes Featuring Whole Grains, Fruits, Vegetables, and Gluten-Free Ingredients]] came out, I found fewer recipes that appealed to me; most of the \"whole-grain\" recipes still called for large amounts of refined white flour and added wheat gluten.<br \/><br \/>So when I saw \"Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day,\" I was willing to give it a shot. Normally, I'll just purchase frozen pizza dough, so I was looking forward to making my own using the same method I'd had success with for breads and rolls. Be forewarned: the book is primarily a pizza dough book, with numerous variations on the master dough recipe (\"00\" flour, which is what is used in Italy for pizza and pasta), semolina, whole wheat, spelt, cornmeal olive oil) and various international breads like naan (there was a naan recipe in the first \"Artisan Bread in 5,\" but this one includes the tenderizing addition of yogurt), chapati, homemade tortillas (corn and flour), and injera.<br \/><br \/>The pizza sauces are more of an afterthought to the dough; the basic \"tomato topping\" consists of \"four 14.5-ounce or two 28-ounce cans crushed or diced tomatoes: the world's simplest pizza topping.\" The homemade barbecue sauce is a winner, though, with its complex flavor profile of orange juice, dark brown sugar, chili powder and paprika in addition to tomatoes, onion, ketchup and vinegar. You'll also find recipes for pesto, bechamel, and tomatillo sauce. The pizza recipes themselves include some interesting combinations like curried sweet potato, lentil and arugula, Brussels sprouts, smoked pancetta and pecorino, and rainbow beet pizza. Instructions for cooking pizza on an outdoor grill are also included. The cheesy breadsticks are easy to throw together and are far superior to most chain restaurants' breadsticks.<br \/><br \/>In addition to the pizzas and flatbreads, there's also a nice assortment of easy-to-make Mediterranean dips, including hummus (their version uses 1\/2 cup tahini, which results in a silky-smooth texture), baba ghanoush, the underappreciated ajvar (a Croatian spread made from roasted red peppers), the Greek dips tzatziki and skordalia, Italian caponata, and French tapenade, that are perfect to whip together for an informal get-together. There are a few substantial soups with international flair, including curried lentil soup, Cuban black bean soup, Scandinavian fish soup, and Spanish Galician Potato Soup with Greens and Chorizo. The desserts are kind of an afterthought and definitely one of the weaker points of the book.<br \/><br \/>Like most good baking books, ingredients are measured by volume (U.S.) and U.S. and metric weights. For baking, weighing is more accurate than volume, since flour can absorb moisture (and thus become denser), altering the amount of flour on a dry vs. humid day. My advance reader copy has relatively few black-and-white photos, so I can't comment on the final printing, but what step-by-step photos are provided are helpful.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line: if you're new to the 5-minute, no-knead method (this is NOT the same one as [[ASIN:0393066304 My Bread: The Revolutionary No-Work, No-Knead Method]] or [[ASIN:1118169433 Kneadlessly Simple: Fabulous, Fuss-Free, No-Knead Breads]], as you're not baking the bread at very high heat inside a Dutch oven), I recommend picking up [[ASIN:0312362919 Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking]] first, as it's simply more versatile than \"Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day.\" If you're looking specifically for practical pizza dough recipes, then this is the book for you!<br \/><br \/>P.S.: It's well worth the investment to purchase a baking stone, pizza peel and [[ASIN:B002PMV77G Cambro RFS6PPSW2190 6-Quart Round Food-Storage Container with Lid, Set of 2]] to help you get started.

{"rating":4,"title":"The haunted life of a muse...","text":"Elizabeth Hickey's \"The Wayward Muse\" imagines the secret longings of Jane Burden, wife of British designer and socialist William Morris. As the novel begins, we're plunged into the squalid poverty of Jane's rough home life, where she's regularly starved for lack of food (it goes to her father and brother, who spend all day drinking) and hit by her mother. One day Jane and her sister Bessie happen upon a mysterious, well-dressed gentleman who turns out to be Dante Gabriel Rossetti, preeminent Pre-Raphaelite. Rossetti is intrigued by Jane's long neck and unusual looks, and begs her to model for him. Despite her mother's initial suspicions, Jane models for him and has a brief, passionate affair with Rossetti before he leaves.<br \/><br \/>Rossetti's friend William Morris is struggling to find his artistic niche; he lacks a painter's eye, but he's quite good at coming up with designs for wallpaper, furniture, and tapestries. He's plodding and dull, but he offers Jane the chance to escape her wretched poverty and to live the life of a lady (his family made their fortune in mining). Jane is torn between her fierce sexual attraction to Rossetti and William's (dull) promise of stability, but she must think of her future. As an added insult, William's mother insists that Jane attend finishing school to teach her how to run a household and the manners that a high-born lady needs to function in society.<br \/><br \/>Jane becomes a dutiful wife and mother even as William becomes increasingly distant and absorbed in his work. Luckily for Jane, his bedroom visits are mercifully few and far between (if anything, Morris's character is frankly asexual). However, Rossetti continues to haunt her, insisting on continuing to paint Jane even as the two start up a not-so-secret affair. The remainder of the novel traces the falling-out from their affair and Rossetti's increasing dependence on chloral, alcohol, and his bizarre behavior.<br \/><br \/>Hickey paints a bleak portrait of 19th-century Oxford slums that magically takes on the softness of the English countryside as Jane is given a second chance. Richly textured with medieval legends of King Arthur and his court, the various tapestries, wallpapers, and patterns truly come alive, as do Jane's marvelously daring outfits that she creates herself. Some reviewers who are intimately familiar with art history and Victorian England complain about the artistic liberties taken with dates and fact, but as a casual reader, I found this to be poetic and touching. Jane is a spirited narrator who's torn between her duty and newfound station, and her heart's true passion; a woman forced to make an impossible choice for a life of passionless stability over one with a penniless, exotic artist with the soul of a poet. Her inner struggle to reconcile her own passions with her unending weariness at caring for a large home and several children will instantly resonate with today's overworked working mothers. It's a magical read that fans of historical art fiction will surely enjoy.","images":[],"asin":"0743273192","parent_asin":"0743273192","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1227314029000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3042,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Sometimes Puzzling, But Interesting for Exotic Setting, French Legal Procedures","text":"In the French legal system, an investigating magistrate (a judge designated \"juge d'instruction\") performs the fact-gathering job carried out by a police detective in the United States or Great Britain.  Thus THE HONEST FOLK OF GUADELOUPE is actually a police procedural novel, set on a Caribbean island that is geographically located in the West Indies but politically a part of France.<br \/><br \/>In this book, \"madame le juge d'instruction\" Anne Marie Laveaud looks into two suspicious deaths.  First, there is the \"suicide\" of a popular television personality who threw himself off a 14-story building when police visited his office to inquire about his alleged misappropriation of some public funds.  Second, there is the mysterious death of a young tourist woman whose body is found, without any obvious cause of death, decomposing on a little-used, remote beach.<br \/><br \/>Despite political pressure to close the TV personality's case without further investigation, madame le juge conducts her usual formal investigation.  She reasons that jumping off a roof is a rather extreme response to the TV personality's potentially being ordered to pay a fine that he could easily afford to pay; besides, the personality's wife is claiming that \"the police hounded him to death\", and there are rumors that the police may have caused the death.  Still, madame le juge puts the case temporarily aside, and concentrates for most of the novel on determining the cause of the tourist's death.  The tourist's death must be explained, because of its potential for negatively impacting Guadeloupe's tourist-based economy.  Eventually madame le juge gets to the bottom of both cases, though I found the outcomes mildly unsatisfying.<br \/><br \/>The novel is constructed in a puzzling fashion.  The story is told almost entirely through Anne Marie's conversations as they are conducted in the course of her investigations, with the result that it jumps around a lot and can be hard to follow.  The reader has to work a bit to remember (or figure out) why madame le juge is interviewing certain individuals at particular times.  Also, background characters (e.g., madame le juge's long-suffering, self-deprecating law clerk, Monsieur Trousseau) are frequently introduced for the first time in conversations, and then the explanations of who they are will follow a page or two later.  Also, madame le juge's own character is puzzling, because she's suddenly thinking about returning permanently to France, even though she's established herself on Guadeloupe for ten or twelve years, and she and her children have developed strong emotional attachments to Guadeloupe.<br \/><br \/>The novel has excellent descriptions of the physical island of Guadeloupe.  It also contains a lot of analysis of local attitudes toward skin color and ethnicity that seem to drive residents' daily interactions.  The analysis rings true, but is somewhat surprising--as politically incorrect--to this U.S. reader.  Because I've never visited Guadeloupe, I can't say whether the locals really do take skin color and ethnicity so heavily into account in the island's political and social structure.  Because of its exotic setting, well-described French legal procedures, and reasonably well-done plot, I rate THE HONEST FOLK OF GUADELOUPE at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1616953853","parent_asin":"1616953853","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1423113022000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3355,"length_group":3}

Dani has the unnerving ability to read people by the trash they leave behind. Receipts, parking tickets, the detritus of daily life—if you leave it behind, she will figure you out.  Her latest case involves high-tech industrial espionage at a corporation with ties to the military. The client, Patrick Swan of Swan Technologies, says he has no further need of Rasmund’s services.

I guess I was expecting an anthology of Seattle writing, but what I got was the equivalent of sitting in a coffee shop and listening to writers gossip about the local writer's scene.  It was interesting to get this kind of insiders look at what has happened and is happening in Seattle, but make sure that that is what you are looking for.<br \/><br \/>The book also points out that I don't know much about the Seattle scene beyond Tom Robbins and he was placed right up front in the very first pages. Also they played the Pynchon card at the same time, leaving me with a lot of poets that I didn't know. There is a long litany of name dropping that was pretty much lost on my except for the musical notes.  I appreciated hearing that Sleater-Kenny came into a writers bookshop far more that hearing that someone remembers seeing the godfather of Seattle poetry get out of his car once. But I did end the book with a feeling that there was this close knit group churning out writing in the flavor of the northwest.  In the end, I envied them for having this community and would love to be able to fit in, know the inside jokes and name drop along side them.<br \/><br \/>The purpose of the book is to support a campaign to get internationally recognized as a center for literature.

{"rating":4,"title":"Stunning wedding idea book but best suited for those who have money to spend","text":"This is a stunning and large hardcover book designed for the bride and groom-to-be to guide them in styling their wedding. The first part of the book goes over wedding basics from flowers, stationery, dress basics, picking a venue date, etc. The second part provides ideas for the six wedding styles of romantic, lavish, modern, elegant, rustic, and vintage.<br \/><br \/>As I was reading through this, I like the questions proposed that allows the bride and groom to decide what type of wedding they are looking for. This books entices one to dream and provides reasons for hiring a pro, deciding what type of calligraphy one might want on their invitations, etc. Obviously, this is mostly for people who have money to spend or at least what to dream what they would do with it if they had it. It is less useful for those spending less than $10,000 on a wedding.<br \/><br \/>The only big negative is that some of the text in this lovely volume is written in white letters over pale pink or medium pinkish letters over pale pink making it very hard to read those sections--especially for my aging eyes. In addition, the front cover of my book was creased which distorted the word \"wedding\" as can be seen in one of my photos. It is mainly for these two reasons I took off one star. Other than this, this coffee table wedding book is just gorgeous and contains lots to consider before planning one's big day.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE 6\/4\/2020 - I gave this to my upstairs neighbor who is a bride-to-be and she said she likes the way this book is laid out. She said this is very nicely done.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61AMIDPa3QL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61AMIDPa3QL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61AMIDPa3QL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61Kegv1oZiL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61Kegv1oZiL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61Kegv1oZiL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/715Vnz205TL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/715Vnz205TL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/715Vnz205TL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71YXTxyt42L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71YXTxyt42L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71YXTxyt42L.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1465481311","parent_asin":"1465481311","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1590296730629,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1579,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"The history of cheese from BC to AC","text":"This is definitely a history book about the unusual subject of \"cheese.\"  The author examines various texts, mythology, bible quotes, and archaeological evidence and uses these references as supporting evidence that cheese existed shortly after 7000 BC. For example in archaeology, examination of vessels provided evidence of cheese making and cheese residue. There were cheese offerings related to religious beliefs and culture.<br \/><br \/>With regard to his quoting bible verses, whether I believe the bible is fiction or not does not matter. The author's intent is that if someone could write about cheese in the bible, then it must have existed and based on his conclusions I would agree.<br \/><br \/>During the Bronze age (3200 to 1200 BC) the use of rennett in cheese making was well established.  He talks about the Hittite Civilization (around 1400 BC) and based on historical records that include the terms scoured or finished cheese and aged soldier cheese, he speculates these were hard-rind cheeses which meant rennet coagulation was used in their production.<br \/><br \/>Rennett coagulation could be either plant-based (as in the use of fig sap) or animal-based (the enzyme from the stomach of various animals). I would have liked to know how man discovered that he could use animal rennet as I don't feel this book was able to solve that question.<br \/><br \/>Due to the references to very old history (Mesopotamia, Bronze Age, Neolithic Revolution, the Fertile Crescent, Chalcolithic or Copper-Stone Age, etc.), I found this book a bit difficult to digest.  What I mean by this is that the history was easy to read about because the author wrote it so well but there were so many facts to eras I know nothing about that each fact upon fact went in one side of my brain and out the other.  I can't remember much of anything although it was quite clear that cheese making has been going on for centuries and is very tied to culture based on the evidence that he provides.<br \/><br \/>The last few chapters of the book were really interesting and much easier to grasp. For instance around the 18th century timeframe he writes:<br \/>  \"Seeds from the plant named turnsole (Chrozophora tinctoria) were ground up and pressed to extract the juice.  Linen cloths were then soaked in the juice, dried, and hung over a basin filled with urine, from which ammonia vapors were absorbed into the linen.  The alkaline ammonia converted the turnsole dye to a violet color. Edam cheeses were rubbed with the turnsole rags impregnated with the voilet dye, which imparted a dark violet color to the surface that changed to glowing red when the surface dried.  The turnsole treatment was not only visually stunning but also acted as an insect repellent, protecting the rind from maggots and other pests that were so troublesome for aged cheeses.\"<br \/><br \/>Throughout the book he also mentions how cheese quality was lowered because most of the cream was being used to make butter.  He ends the book with a discussion about the Appellation d'Origine Controlee (AOC) and the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) which are rules governing the naming of cheeses and other regulations concerning cheese. It's apparent to me that different governments are playing a tug of war with our food system that extends way beyond the raw milk controversy associated with cheese.  This tug of war (which I find disturbing) results in the differing regulations they implement or change.<br \/><br \/>Overall, \"Cheese and Culture\" is an interesting read filled with lots of facts about cheese and cheese making as it relates to our history and culture.","images":[],"asin":"1603584110","parent_asin":"1603584110","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1336883525000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3628,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"A Good but Not Great Read, Unevenly Paced","text":"I was a little disappointed with this book after I saw the Oprah book club praised it as one of the top twenty books I'll read this year.  which it might because I probably read about twenty five a year, but if it gets in the top twenty, it may be more on sample size rather than its own merits.  It definitely was not a bad book, but I don't feel that it was a great book.<br \/><br \/>The development of the character was slow, slow enough that I put this book down for over a month before returning to it.  The main characters childhood was developed in broad anectdotes that did slowly come together, but it did read slowly at the beginning.  The book definitely sped up after he snuck out of the orphanage and started living on the streets of Point Noire.  In fact I was starting to get into his progress when inexplicably suddenly, he was struck by brain lesions and the book careened in a new direction.  Perhaps true to life, but as I was waiting for the character to live up to his fated name of Black Moses, his whole life is thrown into confusion and weirdness.  Perhaps this section provided the best humor and tension as I hoped for a cure though.<br \/><br \/>In the end I came away thinking it was good to read, although I have a history of studying the region so I appreciated a lot of the book that someone new to west central Africa would not.  I'm glad I read it, but I don't know how long it will stick with me.  I will say this, hoping not to be a spoiler, The very end twist struck me as very strong.

{"rating":4,"title":"Game Warden Bowditch Investigates Prison Corruption, Crossbow Attack on Dog\/Wolf","text":"ALMOST MIDNIGHT (MIKE BOWDITCH MYSTERIES) is the tenth entry in this entertaining series featuring Maine game warden Mike Bowditch (the first is [[ASIN:1250161657 The Poacher’s Son]]); it works fine as a standalone.  The author does a marvelous job of immersing the reader in the remote Maine woods scene.  The plot involves administrative corruption within a Maine prison (corruption that causes a few inmate deaths), but it mostly centers on Mike’s search for the person who shot--and probably mortally wounded--his escaped dog\/wolf (Shadow) with a crossbow.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, Mike’s incarcerated best friend (Billy Cronk) urgently summons him to the Maine State Prison, and asks him to investigate the new CO, a sergeant named Dawn Richie.  Mike barely gets started before Richie is ambushed and wounded in the prison laundry room.  The ambush leaves a prison guard dead, and lands two inmates (one is Billy) in the nearest hospital.  More mayhem ensues when one of the injured inmates gets loose and takes a nurse hostage.<br \/><br \/>When the situation clears, Mike concentrates on identifying Shadow’s attacker.  This puts him in touch with a crazy North Woods distiller (Alcohol Mary), a newly established Amish enclave, a young couple dwelling in a yurt, and a wealthy, homicidal landowner (Gorman Peaslee) who is determined to eradicate the Amish.  Mike also touches base with many game warden friends, and pursues his relationship with Dani Tate.<br \/><br \/>The novel illustrates the changes occuring in northern Maine (e.g., the local impact of the closing of a huge paper mill).  It paints a very detailed picture of the area, but it never, ever reads like a travelogue.  The characters are extremely well-developed.  The plot is interesting, though it is driven by Mike’s pursuit of Shadow’s attacker far more than by the murders of the humans, and the Shadow plot gets tiresome over the course of a full-length novel.  The action-packed conclusion is both exciting and satisfying.","images":[],"asin":"1250102413","parent_asin":"1250102413","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1562778305035,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2000,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"To Be Swallowed","text":"I don't always rely on an author's pedigree to suggest whether or not I should read a book, but marketers definitely know what they're doing when they put \"Best Selling Author of...\" or \"Pulitzer Prize-Winning Author of...\", etc, on the front cover of a non-award-winning book by the same author. While perusing the New Books sections at my library with crooked neck, surveying the titles, the name Anita Brookner caught my eye. \"Didn't she...?\" I thought to myself, unable to finish the thought confidently. And then I saw it on the front cover, confirmation that I had indeed likely heard of her (though I had never read another book): \"Booker Prize-Winning Author of Hotel du Lac.\" It could have been that recommendation, plus the personally attractive title Leaving Home, plus the prim and proper Portrait of a Young Woman in a Red Dress (Imre Goth, 1931) as the jacket art that all combined to convince me to spend a little time with Ms. Brookner. Overall, I'm glad I did.<br \/><br \/>The book is deceivingly thin, the text quite dense. Leaving Home is about Emma Roberts, a young twenty-something struggling less to to \"leave\" than to truly define \"home.\" She lives in London with her lymphatic, widowed mother, whom she describes as \"a woman so inactive, her days reserved for reading and thinking. I soon learned not to disturb either process.\" Emma herself is contrained to live a reserved and thoughtful life, always desiring to break through that shell, but never fully motivated to do so. She does defy the wishes of her mother and unlikeable uncle by leaving London to study in France. Her major of choice? Classical garden design. She explains, \"I was in search of a symmetry, a place of excellence that I should recognize and somehow make my own. I had no way of attaining this condition myself, but I felt that here was a concept that inspired a standard of behavior far removed from the tame and unambitious customs that were my true inheritance.\"<br \/><br \/>While in France, Emma meets Francoise, a bright and energetic friend to contrast her own subdued demeanor. Their friendship, on the surface, is an unlikely one. Francoise frequently regales Emma with stories of her male conquests and displays little in the way of genuine concern for Emma's own inability to make intimate connections. Francoise is more curious than anything about Emma's remote personality. I enjoyed the many interactions between these two women, particularly the way in which Emma identifies their different roles in the friendship. She understands that she is to be patient and longsuffering with Francoise, that she is \"safe,\" uncomplicated, no threat to the exuberant French woman (who, understandably, does not get on well with other women). Francoise, for her part, is meant to supply the adventures and irrepresible joie de vive that Emma herself can't muster. Emma becomes more aware of herself through this friendship, and though there is ultimately no significant change to her outlook on life, she make some interesting observations. \"I deduced that my inclinations were fraternal rather than romantic, that I preferred this kind of stasis to the rapid conquests practised by those young women who had been liberated into behaving like men, and of whom Francoise was the perhaps the ideal representative.\"<br \/><br \/>I think Brookner does a wonderful job of creating a place in this book, or two places really - London and Paris. I know nothing of either of these two cities, but Emma make plenty of interesting connections between the two. \"[In Paris] there was an almost palpable air of renewed enthusiasm in the steps of the passersby, in greetings to neighbours, to cafe owners, to waiters who appeared on the doorsteps of restaurants to sniff the air and extend the city's hospitality to their regular patrons. It was impossible to contemplate leaving all this for London, which I perceived as apocalyptic terms, grey, lowering, morose....\" Not all is dandy in Paris, however. I enjoyed two of Emma's many reflections on the difficulty of French living: \"But this was somehow part of living in France, doing the infinitesimal wrong thing. It was part of the bararism of being English\" ~and~ \"It's an eternal apprenticeship, trying to be like the French.\"<br \/><br \/>It is difficult to say if Emma really ever succeeds in \"leaving home.\" She spends much of the book back and forth between London and Paris, each populated by an untraditional (yet completely fitting with her reality) version of a lover. It seems that the moment she's in Paris, she longs for London, but the moment she's in London, all she can think of is Paris. She concedes, \"I was now rootless in two places.\" I think the least satisfying part of the book is that she doesn't undergo the kind of change I was hoping to see. It's Francoise, ironically, who undergoes the greatest transformation. Emma more or less excuses her lack of epiphany by closing the book with \"Not everyone is born to fulfil a heroic role.\" While I had to raise a brow at that, I do like how the thought continues, \"The only realistic ambition is to live in the present. And sometimes, quite often in fact, this is more than enough to keep one busy.\"<br \/><br \/>The Seattle Times wrote of Brookner's novel, The Rules of Engagement: \"Every page has a felicity of wording that makes you want to...underline passages that you don't want to forget.\" I found that to be true of Leaving Home as well. Since it's a library copy, I kept with my post-its, but even then they littered the pages. If I had been more diligent, I would have placed different colored sticky notes at all the words I didn't know, and then looked them up in a dictionary. But I'm a mom, and sometimes it's a miracle that I find time to read books like this at all. I would like to go back through this some day, though, for I am certain to improve my vocabulary by leaps and bounds if I looked up all the words that were new to me.<br \/><br \/>Hopefully as a benefit to you, here are just a few passages I did mark:<br \/><br \/>*\"Our minds, our feelings can be altered by the most random circumstance, symmetry and order reduced to a dull pattern by the display of the alternative, after which hard work will be needed to put the original values back in place.\"<br \/><br \/>*(regarding the book she is writing): \"He probably regarded my work as the equivalent of embroidering a sampler....\"<br \/><br \/>*(in reference to Paris): \"...I arrived, smelt the coffee and the cigarettes, sidestepped the water thrown in an arc to sluice the morning pavements, bought my newspaper, and appreciated once more a lack of obligations....\"<br \/><br \/>*\"It takes a kind of genius to save one's own life.\"<br \/><br \/>*\"We were as one, perhaps, in the knowledge that the future had failed us, that life had not proceeded in the straight line on which we had once relied. Such knowledge is not diserable, and is moreover impossible to impart to those untouched by it.\"<br \/><br \/>I'm not placing this novel in the \"Chewed and Digested\" category, because as I said, I was disappointed by the ending. I understand that in real life it's true that people rarely change as much as we'd like them to, but in fiction I demand a little more than that. Still, this is a fabulous book and an interesting tour through a tale of one woman and two cities.","images":[],"asin":"1400095654","parent_asin":"1400095654","user_id":"AGGHHNTNWUXUG2LEOP4KGUMULISQ","timestamp":1177428689000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":7341,"length_group":3}

In an effort to appease his mother, he travels with a guy named Weston that he recently met at work.

Jedidiah felt there was more to life than just working and wanted to experience living instead of just letting life pass by him.<br \/><br \/>He is gay and partially religious and spends a lot of the journey contemplating both. Weston on the other hand is spontaneous, heterosexual, ill-prepared, and without much money (other than what he squirreled away to buy dope).

The murderer part is okay, though, because her hometown (Edgeport, Maine) has lots of murderers who haven't been caught (a dysfunctional small town?); and Harte’s murder was a “good” murder.  Her victim (Clint) was an evil man.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, Harte sets out to solve a domestic mystery--who is the biological father of Mackenzie Bell, the daughter of Harte’s now-deceased former best friend Maggie?  Maggie was sexually abused by her father Clint, and as a troubled teen, she slept around.  Mackenzie, when she learns who the Edgeport possibilities are, has second thoughts about the project to find out “where she came from”.  Edgeport is an inbred backwater of a town.<br \/><br \/>But there's more to the story than a paternity search.  Harte’s beloved Jake is threatened by a pair of blackmailers (can’t you trust a hired hit man to take your money and be done with it?).  Both end up murdered, though it's clear that Jake didn't do them, because he wouldn't have left any mess.  The killers’ identities are ultimately revealed in a last-minute surprise ending.<br \/><br \/>This is almost a “cozy” mystery, because it's leisurely paced, and mostly focused on people and relationships.  But it's also a decent PI procedural.  I enjoyed it, but am not sure that I want to read any more “Audrey Harte” series books.  I liked Jake a lot, but didn't care much for Harte, even though she is an independent professional woman with believable investigative skills.","images":[],"asin":"0316302554","parent_asin":"0316302554","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1505069959258,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1811,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"Very good introductory book","text":"\"DNA & Genealogy\" is very good at defining and explaining important terms like: 1) Nucleotides (A, G, C, and T base pairs) where sequences of them provide information for the creation of proteins in order to sustain life. 2) Nuclear DNA - used to trace paternal ancestry and Mitochondrial DNA - used to trace maternal ancestry. And, these can be used to do so because they are nonrecombinant, passing down virtually unchanged over thousands of years. 3)  Alleles, DYS numbers, haplogroups, markers, MRCA -most recent common ancestor, STR, SNP, etc.<br \/><br \/>Some other explanations in the book I think worth mentioning here are:<br \/><br \/>1. Regarding the Human genome - it is a tightly wound string of DNA so long, comprising of 3,147M base pairs - it would stretch to the Sun and back.<br \/><br \/>2. Most mutations have no effect except occasionally.<br \/><br \/>3. Surname studies exist and the book shows where to locate them. Plus, the book describes different DNA tests which exist.<br \/><br \/>4. There is a worthwhile discussion about \"errors\" - that looking at a sample of something, one can rationally come up with probabilities of how long the sample is removed from the original. The same reasoning could be used evaluating copies of a manuscript and of course, DNA mutations. Plus, there is a discussion about stepwise and infinite allele models for handling DNA mutations.<br \/><br \/>5. Kleinfelter's syndrome is discussed - the rare existence of extra X chromosomes for some people.<br \/><br \/>6. Gender-related intelligence differences are on the X chromosome - explaining why girls are generally more intelligent, but there are more boys who are retarded and more super intelligent. Hence, although the average girl IQ is equal to the average boy, the distibution is not the same. Mutations, and girls having an extra X chromosome explain the differences, which compensate for mutations. Plus, no human trait has evolved more than intelligence.<br \/><br \/>7. In rare cases, mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the father.<br \/><br \/>The only real negative about the book, is that it is several years old, and more is new, like new testing services, like 23andMe.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, the book is a good one, for introducing a reader to the study of ancestry using DNA.","images":[],"asin":"0976716011","parent_asin":"0976716011","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1233769600000,"helpful_vote":14,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2284,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"A timely book","text":"\"Nudge\", a behavioral economics book, is very good at giving a reader perhaps a peak into President Obama's mind as he attempts to tackle some pretty big issues like healthcare, the environment, education and the financial urgencies of Medicare and Social Security. In his first few months in office, he does seem to be trying to win the support of political moderates just as this book presents such a case with its concept of \"libertarian paternalism\". The concept presents a case for giving people many choices while at the same time trying to have them lean toward directions which would likely be in their best interests. Some points from the book which caught my attention are:<br \/><br \/>1. Small details can have major impacts on people's behavior.<br \/><br \/>2. A \"nudge\" is an aspect of choice architecture which alters human behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or changing their economic incentives.<br \/><br \/>3. Never underestimate the power of inertia. The power can be harnessed by default options, for example. 'Econs' are people who respond to economic incentives. 'Humans' are people who respond to incentives AND nudges. Therefore, incentives and nudges help everyone.<br \/><br \/>4. It is false to assume almost everyone all the time makes choices in their best interest.<br \/><br \/>5.  There are two kinds of thinking:  intuitive\/automatic (the oldest, like with voters and teenage drivers) and reflective\/rational.<br \/><br \/>6. The book goes into rules of thumb like 'anchoring', 'availabilty' and 'representativeness' which affect how people make decisions.<br \/><br \/>7. Optimism\/overconfidence and loss aversion affect decisions.<br \/><br \/>8. Temptation\/dynamic-inconsistency can be handled.<br \/><br \/>9. 'Following the herd' must be managed.<br \/><br \/>10. 'The spotlight effect' - people unnecessarily tend to think others are watching them. So, investment clubs with conformists tend to do poorly, for instance.<br \/><br \/>11. The golden rule of 'nudges' is when they are most likely to help and least likely to cause harm.<br \/><br \/>12. Expect errors - humans are prone to making errors.<br \/><br \/>13. If Social Security is changed to allow investment choices, well thought-out defaults would be good. Medicare Part D is too cumbersome the way it is now, with about 2\/3 making the wrong choices.<br \/><br \/>14. Asymmetric paternalism - help the least sophisicated while imposing the least on the most sophisticated.<br \/><br \/>The book also goes into over thirty nudges on various issues. Overall, the book is timely in giving a reader a clue into how some major issues facing the government might be handled, in order to have the best chance of progressing and working.","images":[],"asin":"014311526X","parent_asin":"014311526X","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1243280277000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2728,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"A wake-up call on eating and living green for kids and their parents","text":"Lunch Lessons is an in-depth expose of how our unhealthy American diet is literally killing us, particularly its impact on our kids who participate in the USDA school lunch program. Nearly 80% of American schools don't meet the USDA's nutritional requirements. This doesn't come as a surprise seeing as schools are expected to provide a full meal for $1.50 per child. Many schools have done away with kitchens entirely, and rely on reheating processed foods. Financially-strapped districts raise money for extracurricular activities by contracts with soft drink and fast food companies, fueling the current childhood obesity crisis.<br \/><br \/>Lunch Lessons looks at the impact of revolutionary school lunch programs that aim to reconnect students with their food by raising their own vegetables from seeds, performing investigations, and preparing the fruits of their labor. Other featured schools buy locally grown organic produce for slightly more than commercial brands, and prepare meals that are proportioned appropriately and contain whole grains, fruits and vegetables without additives, extra sugars, or fat. There are also suggestions on how to \"green\" your home by buying eco-friendly cleaners,  composting and recycling, and green dining and shopping alternatives. The book is scattered with statistics on American obesity, diet-related disease, and sidebars, but the placement was disruptive to the text and I frequently lost my place as I skipped around reading the various doom-and-gloom factoids.<br \/><br \/>The rest of the book consists of recipes taken from the various schools and programs mentioned earlier in the book, and include selections for breakfast, snacks, and lunch. Full nutritional info is included, as well as a conversion guide to figure out the daily values for various ages (the standard nutritional info is based on a 2,000 calorie diet, which is about two times too high for very young children, and not enough for an active teen). Many of the recipes are vegetarian and are low-fat, and are simple enough that older children could prepare these on their own. Some of the more interesting choices included frittata with spinach, mushrooms, and cheese, peanut butter and jelly power muffins, fruit smoothie, orzo salad, pumpkin curry, carrot-ginger soup, and red lentil burgers, although many sounded adventurous for picky eaters.","images":[],"asin":"0060783702","parent_asin":"0060783702","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1212714919000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2367,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Good Guide to Using Features of Samsung Galaxy S9, S9+ Smartphones","text":"SAMSUNG GALAXY S9 FOR DUMMIES actually covers both the Galaxy S9 (2 camera lenses) and the slightly larger S9+ (3 camera lenses) smartphones.  If you’re completely new to Android smartphones, you’ll especially welcome the “Surviving Unboxing Day” guide to answering the questions you’re asked during the initial setup.  Otherwise, you’ll find the book useful for the Galaxy-specific tips (e.g., how to use the multi-touch screen gestures unique to the newer Galaxy phones).<br \/><br \/>There’s some early bad advice about determining what carrier an “unlocked” S9 phone lacking a carrier logo will work with.  It suggests taking the phone to a cellular store (good advice) or taking the back off the phone to look for an IMEI or GSM stamp (bad advice).  The S9 is a glued-together phone without a removable battery, and removing the back is not only difficult, but will destroy the water resistance.<br \/><br \/>Two sections that I found useful were the instructions for setting up Samsung Pay and the description of the capabilities of Bixby Vision (e.g., telling you what an object is and what it costs online when you point the phone’s camera at the object).<br \/><br \/>Like all the “for Dummies” books, this one is quirky in its presentation, because the “for Dummies” publisher has a template that authors must conform to (always ending with “The Part of Tens”).  The template requires the material to be somewhat artificially categorized and organized.<br \/><br \/>The book’s chapter titles are as follows:  (1) Exploring What You Can Do With Your Phone, (2) Beginning at the Beginning, (3) Calling People, (4) Discovering the Joy of Text, (5) Sending and Receiving Email, (6) Managing Your Contacts, (7) You’ve Got the Whole (Web) World in Your Hands, (8) Playing in Google’s Play Store, (9) Sharing Pictures, (10) Playing Games, (11) Mapping Out Where You Want to Be, (12) Playing Music and Videos, (13) Using the Calendar, (14) Talking with Bixby, (15) Paying with Samsung Pay, (16) Ten Ways to Make Your Phone Totally Yours, (17) Ten (or So) Ways to Make Your Phone Secure, and (18) Ten Features to Look for Down the Road.<br \/><br \/>The book has an excellent index.

{"rating":4,"title":"\"Cancerland\" is more about how the science of cancer has evolved than anything else from one doctor's point of view","text":"The Amazon description that states &#34;A doctor’s riveting story of loss and hope in the world of cancer. What is it like to encounter cancer? How does it feel to face the unknown, to enter a world of hope, loss, and dread?&#34; lead me to believe that this book was more about individual stories of cancer patients one doctor has encountered over his career and its emotional toll on patient, doctor, and family. However, this book is not about that at all.<br \/><br \/>It is true that Dr. Scadden knew of three people who died of cancer when he was a child living in Wykcoff, New Jersey. One was a friend's mother, then a lady neighbor, and the third was a classmate in second grade. His mother and father also died of cancer when he was an adult. Other than this and a few mentions of people who have been cured of cancer or died as a result of this or that trial, he really discusses how cancer research has evolved over the years.<br \/><br \/>This is a book more about the science of cancer than anything else and how various researchers or doctors made scientific discoveries as it concerns cancer or stem cells. Unfortunately, this was not the type of book I was expecting or would have selected to read had I known what was inside. Nevertheless, it is written in an engaging manner and is easy for a lay person to understand. Although I am unable to maintain any knowledge of the science, doctors, and researchers involved in this or that discovery, I did learn several things from this text.<br \/><br \/>- First, cancer is extremely complex and the treatment is just as complicated.<br \/><br \/>- Second, not everyone responds to the same therapy. Some people have cancers with a genetic profile that makes them more susceptible to  a specific drug regimen or cure.<br \/><br \/>- Some therapies that seem promising in the beginning can turn out to not be such a breakthrough in the end.<br \/><br \/>- In some cases, finding the cells that can fight cancer and regenerating them outside the body and then injecting them back into the body, can cure cancer for particular patients. This is the gist of what I understood.<br \/><br \/>- The research done on mice does not necessarily translate to humans. Human stem cells may be the answer to solve this dilemma (and perhaps save a few mice from suffering in the future--my hope, not the author's).<br \/><br \/>- Stem cells hold tremendous promise in the cure for cancer and other medical disciplines such as generating certain organs. Dr. Harald Ott invented a method of working with cells that allowed other researchers to develop human heart muscle cells in a lab that beat like a human heart. Of course, this technique is in its infancy, but the potential is profound.<br \/><br \/>- Despite how detached a doctor may seem when they loose a patient, all (or at least most) are saddened by the loss.<br \/><br \/>It comes through loud and clear in this book that Dr. Scadden is an M.D. (no longer practicing) that is now passionate about doing scientific work with blood stem cells to try to find some cure for cancer or at least to explore its potential in reducing human suffering. I believe it consumes him.<br \/><br \/>Even though I expected something different from this book than what was delivered, I still enjoyed getting a better understanding of what goes on behind the scenes in research. I do feel, however, &#34;Cancerland&#34; will be of more interest to medical researchers, scientists, and those enthusiastic about the historical evolution in search of a cancer cure and not as much interest to a lay person like me.","images":[],"asin":"1250092752","parent_asin":"1250092752","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1525744160180,"helpful_vote":20,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3578,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"A gripping read","text":"Jennifer Lynn Barnes' \"Raised by Wolves\" is a fast-paced look at Were pack life from the view of an outsider. Bronwyn Alessia St. Vincent Clare (Bryn for short) is a tough-as-nails teenager raised by a pack of werewolves. Unlike them, she's fully human, but alpha male Callum has Marked her as his and taken her under his wing. Like any teenager, she chafes against many of Callum's restrictions (tough physical training, curfews, keeping up good grades) and just wants to be left alone to work on her artwork. Bryn carefully shields herself from the Pack's shared thoughts and feral urges, especially during the full moon, and generally doesn't intervene in Pack matters, but when an outside threat tears open old wounds, Bryn must examine her allegiances to the Pack and the definition of \"family.\" She's obsessed with Chase, a fellow Were attack survivor, and will do anything to spend time with him, even if it risks her standing in the Pack.<br \/><br \/>Much of the first half of the book focuses on Pack hierarchy and Pack mentality (the Weres are able to tune into each other's thoughts collectively both as Wolf and human). Bryn's best friend Devon comes off a bit like a token character from Glee...he's a meticulously-groomed Were who lives for movie musicals and belting out showtunes. Bryn's other friend Lake Mitchell lives out-of-state on the periphery of Callum's territory and is a frontier gunslinger. She has the unpleasant distinction of being one of only a handful of female Weres...and the author alludes to some past sexual trauma related to this. The second half focuses on Bryn's hunt for a rogue Were, and the pace picks up considerably.<br \/><br \/>Barnes' writing style vaults between human thoughts and werewolf ones (generally disjointed, in brief bursts of ideas). There are also numerous episodes of graphic violence related to the central plot; it's definitely gorier than a lot of other YA werewolf fiction I've read. Curiously enough, despite the intensely physical nature of Weres, most of the story is asexual. The author definitely treads into some New Age territory with psychic mind melding and being able to see the future, and I would have liked more physical descriptions of the Change (an area that [[ASIN:0385734212 Blood and Chocolate]] fleshed out nicely) that Weres undergo.  Also, the final 30 pages felt a bit anticlimactic and like a setup for an obligatory sequel.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is an engrossing read that fans of werewolf lore will enjoy.","images":[],"asin":"1606840592","parent_asin":"1606840592","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1278202501000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2499,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"A luminous debut that overflows with beauty.","text":"Like author Terry Gamble (of Proctor and Gamble lineage), I've spent nearly every summer of my life in and around Harbor Springs, Michigan, a small Northern Michigan resort community on the Little Traverse Bay. Gamble has drawn from her childhood memories spent on Harbor Point to create the lush settings for Water Dancers, using thinly veiled pseudonyms for Harbor Point (Beck's Point), Harbor Springs (Moss Village), Petoskey (Chibawasee), and Cross Village (Horseshoe Lake).<br \/>The novel's protagonist, Rachael Winnapee, is a sixteen-year old Odawa orphan from Horseshoe Lake who, since the death of her grandmother, has lived at the Indian School in Moss Village (the actual school is alongside the Holy Childhood of Jesus Catholic Church in Harbor Springs), and like many First Nations orphans, is sent to be a domestic at Beck's Point.<br \/>The novel begins in 1945. Rachael ends up serving the March family from St. Louis. The March's sons are both overseas fighting, Lip in Belgium and Woody in the Pacific Theater. When Lip is killed in battle and Woody comes home an amputee and morphine addict, it is up to Rachel to help make Woody whole. The two begin a brief, intense love affair, sealed with seashells, hidden gifts, lovemaking in dunes, shallows and empty rooms, and finally, Rachael's unwanted pregnancy.<br \/>Rachel raises her son Ben on her own, continuing to live with the midwives who delivered her child. After nine years of helping out on their farm, Rachel moves back to Horseshoe Lake with Ben. The novel fast forwards to Ben's experiences fighting in Vietnam and his difficult readjustment to civilian life, and culminates in an unexpected and explosive conclusion in which the past is confronted and old ghosts laid to rest.<br \/>Water Dancers is a multifaceted novel of healing (three of the main characters are veterans), of class and race, duty, discovering inner strength, and seeking peace. The characters are poetically and lovingly crafted, down to the most minor details. Terry Gamble's first novel deliciously brings to life the many moods of water and forest that dominate life in Northern Michigan, and for those who are familiar with Northern Michigan, like Rachael's habit of licking stones, this novel will bring you home.","images":[],"asin":"0060542667","parent_asin":"0060542667","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1081908050000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2266,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"To Be Swallowed","text":"It's hard to believe that I've lived a complete life without reading a book by Mitch Albom. I've managed to value my loved ones, contemplate the nature of life and death, and cry at sappy Hallmark moments, all without ever reading the likes of Tuesdays with Morrie or The Five People You Meet in Heaven. With the release of his newest book, For One More Day, I wondered to myself: what have I been missing? Could my understanding of the world deepen, become more profound, if I just read something by this internationally recognized \"feel good\" author?<br \/><br \/>I'm being a bit of a snob here - hopefully that's obvious. I've looked down my spectacle-saddled nose at Albom and his four-hankie books for a while now, but my curiosity really did get the better of me, and I did read. And you know what? It wasn't so bad! I'm feeling a little repentant now.<br \/><br \/>For One More Day is the story of Charles \"Chick\" Benetto's rise to Major League stardom (using that term loosely) and his fall to shabby drunk. And all the people he hurts in between. The slim book focuses on Chick's attempt to utterly demolish himself, and the redemption he receives at the side of his dead mother. Yes, his dead mother. Chick admits that this could be some kind of ghost story, but it really isn't. It's about what remains when someone is gone, it's about pain that can be healed, it's about choosing to repair what can be repaired, while we can.<br \/><br \/>I enjoyed this little book, and I confess that I did shed a tear or two. I also laughed quite a bit, specifically at two categories that Chick reflects on a good deal: Times My Mother Stood Up for Me, and Times I Did Not Stand Up for My Mother. I laughed because some of the situations were funny, but mostly because they were so familiar. We don't often think of the ways we could have stood up for our parents, honored them for all they have sacrificed for us. In short, I think we don't often think of our parents as people at all. In For One More Day, Chick gets an awesome opportunity to see his mother's life through others' eyes, and understand the value of the person that she was. It ultimately inspires him to understand better the person he himself could be.","images":[],"asin":"1401303277","parent_asin":"1401303277","user_id":"AGGHHNTNWUXUG2LEOP4KGUMULISQ","timestamp":1177428390000,"helpful_vote":16,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2214,"length_group":3}

In essence, then, Rosalba must become sub-human in order to become Virginio's mate.&#34; ~ from the 1984 edition released by Academy Chicago Publishers founded in 1975 by  Jordan and Anita Miller and acquired by Chicago Review Press Inc. in 2013.<br \/><br \/>I can't begin to describe the prose (I come up with the words florid or etheral or melodramtic - but I don't think they fit) so I found a snippet to include:  &#34;The room was called the study, after an English fashion; its air was warm and intimate. Everyone, with the exception of Virginio, preferred it to the pale and mirrored salon where he now sat alone, nibbling a long green strip of angelica and idly perusing the pages of Frederick Martens’ “Natural History of Spitzbergen”. “There grows an Arctic flower&#34;, he read; but his tranquility was now and again shattered by the heat and hurry of voices from the open door.&#34;<br \/><br \/>A terrific biography of the Author can be found by searching &#34;poetry foundation Elinor Wylie&#34;.<br \/><br \/>~ from the 1984 edition released by Academy Chicago Publishers founded in 1975 by  Jordan and Anita Miller and acquired by Chicago Review Press Inc. in 2013.: Elinor Wylie's The Venetian Glass Nephew, published in 1925, is a more fantasy-based take on the Frankenstein tradition. In it, Cardinal Peter Innocent Bon travels to Venice to meet the Pope. Venice is his place of birth, and as he travels excitedly to his destination, he recalls fond memories of his long life. His only regret is that he does not have a nephew. (Since men of the cloth are vowed to celibacy, his only option to fulfill his fatherly tendencies is a nephew.) Peter meets with the Pope, who requests that the Cardinal attend a concert in his stead. On his way out, Peter crosses paths with a glass-blowing sorcerer named Luna, who introduces the Cardinal to his associate, Chevalier M. de Chastelneuf. The two men show Peter their marvelous glass creations and surprise him with a display of sorcery - one of their glass creations comes to life in a display of burning spices and incantations. Pleased with what he sees, the Cardinal requests that the men create for him a nephew, Virginio, a very delicate boy with an appearance much like translucent glass. Some time later, Virginio comes across a young lady named Rosalba, whose hand he soon asks for in marriage. This meeting is revealed to have been planned by Virginio's mentors, Cardinal Peter, the Chevalier, and his tutor Count Gozzi. Gozzi is also a writer whose romantic stories garner the disapproval of Rosalba's guardian, who is a follower and friend of Voltaire. The Chevalier relates the story of Rosalba's birth from a father who was a Cardinal and a mother who was his only true love. The two are soon wed, and all seem pleased. Harmony does not last long, however, as Rosalba's independent and outgoing nature clashes with Virginio's delicate, fragile person. Rosalba dearly loves Virginio, and she would rather die than live in such a torturous situation. After a suicide attempt, the Chevalier suggests a risky proposal that Rosalba accepts. She is to be transformed into porcelain, a living doll devoid of emotion who is a fit companion for Virginio. Due to her sacrifice, everyone lives happily ever after.<br \/><br \/>Rather than rejecting their creation, the creators embrace Virginio. He is a near perfect replica of a human: &#34;Upon the most minute examination, Peter Innocent failed to discover anything in the appearance of his young kinsman-for as such we must henceforward consider him-which could suggest an abhuman origin or composition&#34; (Wylie 59). The Cardinal indeed loves Virginio like a child. In contrast to Frankenstein's creature, Virginio's appearance is fair and inviting. Also, Virginio is created as a child, and he is provided with both family and education by the Cardinal and Count Gozzi. Ultimately, Virginio's interest focuses on companionship, much like Frankenstein's creature. When he meets Rosalba, who &#34;to the five senses of an observer she was indeed imagined flowers to breathe,&#34; he asks her hand in marriage, which initiates the tragedy of the story.<br \/><br \/>Rebelling against her association with Voltaire, the patron saint of reason, Rosalba embraces the fantastic, as written in her favorite Count Gozzi stories, upon introduction to Virginio: &#34;As she took her guardian's congratulatory kiss, she succumbed for the first time in her life to the warm, delightful luxury of complete unreason&#34; (Wylie 82). Thus, the tale of Virginio's birth is accepted by her and dismissed by her guardian, Angelo Querini. Struck by his delicate beauty, Rosalba accepts Virginio's marriage proposal.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, the longer she stays with the fragile Virginio, the more rebellious the athletic, outgoing Rosalba becomes: &#34;'She used never to be so wild a creature while she shared my roof…She was always so studious, so docile, so domestic! God knows what possesses her poor little body; her tranquility is turned to quicksilver&#34; (Wylie 135). This causes a rift between Rosalba and Virginio and they begin to quarrel. Rosalba finally throws herself into a fire where she is saved by the Chevalier, who declares his love for her: &#34;It is such as you will never discover in the hollow veins of Virginio…it is human, not divine, not animal, but the love of mortal for mortal&#34; (Wylie 142). As in Frankenstein, despair catalyzes sacrifice, and for love, Rosalba is willing to do &#34;anything, everything, or nothing&#34; at the Chevalier's advice in order to maintain her relationship with Virginio (Wylie 148). The only option is to transform the flamboyant Rosalba into a porcelain doll, which will condemn her to a life as fragile as that of her lover. Against the protests of the Chevalier, Rosalba makes her final sacrifice, allowing the lovers to forget &#34;fear and the requirements of pity&#34; (Wylie 182).","images":[],"asin":"B001T4ASP8","parent_asin":"B00085L70E","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1396370291000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":6426,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Ninja Foodi users will have to make adjustments with this air fryer book","text":"I ordered this book because I recently purchased a Ninja Foodi and it has an air fryer option besides being a pressure cooker, dehydrator, and slow cooker.<br \/><br \/>This text is thin but has a good overview on the best air fryers to buy and why they like a particular type of air fryer. It does not mention the Ninja Foodi at all. There are about 13 recipes in this cookbook that I would make.  For this review, I decided to make the big Italian meatballs with zucchini noodles. It came out delicious and the prepared dish is shown in the last photo.<br \/><br \/>However, as I started to cook the meatballs, I realized the Foodi does not go lower than 300 degrees for the air fryer option. The recipe calls for 250 degrees. I did keep checking the meatballs during cooking. Unfortunately, I overcooked them just little bit on the last cycle that called for 160 degrees. They just came out a tiny bit dryer than they should have. Nevertheless, I was more successful with cooking the zucchini noodles since that required 400 degrees. The end result was delicious.<br \/><br \/>Note that the recipe called for salt and pepper but the amount of those two ingredients were listed in the text instead of the recipe so one has to be careful to read everything first.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this is a good air fryer recipe book. However, it is not written for someone who has a Ninja Foodi because the temperatures on the Foodi do not go as low as some of the recipes call for. Of course, one can make adjustments and keep watch over the cooking cycles to approximate the necessary cooking times in this situation.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71TVUwlSMjL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71TVUwlSMjL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71TVUwlSMjL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71qkkLburJL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71qkkLburJL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71qkkLburJL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71zA6rZLWyL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71zA6rZLWyL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71zA6rZLWyL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1945256753","parent_asin":"1945256753","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1557194670034,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1605,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"More of a Glossary of Environmental Science","text":"I had really high hopes for this book.  The description described it as a way to help kids digest the concepts.  But it looks like the description has been retooled a bit since I received the book.  I was hoping for a bunch of interactive exercises to better understand complex concepts in life sciences.  I thought it could be a great help in curriculum development, but I was a little disappointed there.<br \/><br \/>I do think they rewrote the description to put it more in line with what the book is, but I'll try to clear it up a little more.  It's not a bad book, but it is what it is.<br \/><br \/>What this book is.<br \/><br \/>- A Glossary of the terms of Environmental Science<br \/>- A fairly complete but not deep overview of the major topics<br \/>- A syllabus of a Environmental Science education<br \/><br \/>The book does have some great illustrations and it defines topics well, but it doesn't do what I was hoping which was to be a tool to help move into a deeper understanding.  Some of the illustrations are fantastic and will be used in presentations and I can see referencing the book for basic definitions, but it will not be shaping curriculum.<br \/><br \/>So why 4 stars.  Because for what it is -  a high altitude survey of Environmental Science, it is very decent.  Judging it for what it is, it is complete and it is well illustrated and written.  But it is not what I was looking or hoping for.  So buyer beware, if you are looking for an outline for a Environmental Science course, this might be your book.  If you are looking to flesh that outline out, you will need to go to other references.","images":[],"asin":"1118167147","parent_asin":"1118167147","user_id":"AGLQQCIS5V6EGUCS5SSNHWZHQM6Q","timestamp":1348124099000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1615,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Well written book about a fantastic soul singer","text":"This book is an excellent read for fans of Wilson Pickett or soul music in general.  It provides inside information, a behind the scenes look, so to speak, about the recordings of Wilson Pickett.  There are stories of how songs were written and what went on in the studios when Pickett’s records were made.  The inner workings of studios like Stax in Memphis or Fame in Muscle Shoals are described in detail, and many of the musicians who played a significant role in Pickett’s recordings are identified.  Even readers who are well versed in the history of soul music are likely to learn something new from reading Tony Fletcher’s book.<br \/><br \/>The personal side of Wilson Pickett’s life is another story, however.  He was a troubled individual whose self-destructive behavior stood in sharp contrast to his enormous talent.  Fletcher provides a complete picture of the man, both good and bad.  Wilson Pickett should probably best be remembered for the many outstanding recordings that made him a soul music legend, but for those readers who want to know the whole story of a complicated artist, Tony Fletcher’s well-researched Pickett biography is probably the best place to look.","images":[],"asin":"0190252944","parent_asin":"0190252944","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1545254265455,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1184,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Good, discussion of our financial system risks","text":"The author says the financial markets can't be controlled, pursuant to the 2008 crash and its aftermath.<br \/><br \/>He says the roots being the financialization of our economy, basically our major industry, based on debt\/leverage to generate such huge profits it attracted many of our brightest minds away from pursuing more fundamentally sound careers to help society, all hidden in such complexity, it was, and still is, impossible to control. Further, the complexity bred mostly short term strategies, leading to a dysfunctional financial system.<br \/><br \/>Also, misguided thinking led to thinking globalization and technology reduced risks, but just increased risks.<br \/><br \/>And Dodd-Frank, he says is too complex, and the EU too flawed, for him to have much confidence.<br \/><br \/>He does say globalization and technology has led to more income inequality, and so much debt in the US made it worse by inflating asset prices. And he says this has led to more booms and busts, creating an intrinsically fragile economy intentionally because of the revolving door between Wall Street and government.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, I do recommend the book despite what I see as an omission like the funding of two wars and tax cuts for the rich, financed by lots of debt, making handling the crisis harder. Also, despite his pessimism, some of the US regulation is an improvement and though formal coordinated international regulation has not been achieved, there is more coordination than before. But, the book does present a good discussion of the risks in our financial system.","images":[],"asin":"0745688314","parent_asin":"0745688314","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1434303245000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1573,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Enlightening and factual representation of what life is like for New York's poor and destitute children","text":"Fire in the Ashes is a well-written book highlighting the paths of several children who grew up in utterly poverty stricken areas of New York, specifically NYC and the South Bronx.  There were a few points that I found enlightening about this story, although I have heard about these issues before.  First, many poor are \"warehoused\" in buildings (apartments and hotels) that should be condemned.  Second, for the most part nothing is done to these slum landlords. Third, the squalor is hidden from the general public in the sense that even if we wanted to enter these buildings, management on duty (in the case of hotels) would prevent us from doing so. Fourth, many times those that are supposed to help the poor actually victimize them further. For instance, managers of the slum hotels exchange sexual favors for overlooking that someone is cooking in their room which was not allowed in the hotel rooms.<br \/><br \/>Jonathan Kozol devotes one or more chapters each to several of the poor children he has encountered over the years and tells an abbreviated version of their life story.  Some stories end badly, a couple end great (Pineapple and Jeremy) considering their circumstances, a couple end just okay such as in the case of Angelo who is staying out of trouble--which is really a success if you think about where he came from. It is clear almost every one of these children had help but not everyone survived even with that help.  Except for the family that moved to Montana that had a lot of help but still failed, it seemed those like Pineapple and Jeremy who are offered better educational opportunities are more likely to succeed.<br \/><br \/>Despite the excellent writing and interesting stories, they were told in a diary-like narrative similar to a statistician reporting facts. Perhaps the author has become hardened by all the tragedy that is has become difficult to infuse his writing with the intense emotion this subject matter deserves. This made the book lack the typical personal connection for me that I should ordinarily feel when reading such a horrendous representation of the struggle these children and their families had to endure.  As a result the facts of each story did not stick in my mind after I was done reading it.<br \/><br \/>On another note, proceeds from the books he writes goes into a fund to help these children; although it was hard to tell if all or just some of the proceeds go into this fund.  I certainly would have liked to know what motivates the author to help and mentor these children. I am amazed at how dedicated he is. Since the interest this author takes in these children is not typical, it makes me wonder if he was one of them.","images":[],"asin":"1400052467","parent_asin":"1400052467","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1346776646000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2689,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Very good, but know what you are getting before you buy","text":"&#34;No Book but the World&#34; is a a very thoughtful, philosophical novel that is on its surface a family saga\/crime story, but is in reality a meditation on the limits of human freedom and the existence of free will.  The main characters, all adults, are brother and sister Ava and Fred, and their childhood friends Kitty and Dennis (who by the time of the novel is married to Ava).  The principal narrator is Ava, who has always felt a combination of responsibility and resentment for Fred, who is impaired in some way that is never fully defined.  Ava and Fred's parents were followers of the philosophy of Jean Jacques Rousseau, especially with respect to his views on education.  They founded a free school based on Rousseau's principles, and Ava and Fred were brought up there in relative isolation from the real world.  This is important because of the interplay of imagination, freedom, and reality that is a constant motif in the book.  Kitty and Dennis are brought up much more conventionally, but they remain close friends.<br \/><br \/>As the book opens, Ava is trying to find out what is going on with her brother, who has been accused of a murder.  There are long sequences of memory and description, and if the reader is looking for a fast-paced, plot-driven narrative, he or she will be very frustrated.  There is little dialogue, and what dialogue exists is only a springboard to more memories and philosophical musings.  The book is divided into five sections, with Fred, Kitty, and Dennis each narrating one, and Ava bookending them with the first and last.  The reader learns about the unusual relationship between the parents and the children, and all the linkages between the past and present.  The events of the present, with all their legal ramifications, are also explored.<br \/><br \/>The theme of this book is most aptly summed up in the frontpiece, a quotation from &#34;Promenade&#34; by Maria Irene Fornes:  &#34;I know everything.  Half of it I really know.  The rest I make up.  The rest I make up.&#34;  This quotation gets to the heart of the book:  What do we really know?  How accurate are our memories?  How do we frame the story of our life so that it makes sense?  How much of what we think we know is really wishful thinking or imagination?  All of these questions are explored in great detail through the narrative.<br \/><br \/>This book is not for everyone.  It is extraordinarily well-written, but the long ruminative passages will be off-putting to some.  However, if you know what to expect and you are interested in a reflection on memory, imagination, and freedom set within an unusual family, you will find this book ultimately rewarding.","images":[],"asin":"1594486034","parent_asin":"1594486034","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1390407053000,"helpful_vote":29,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2684,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"This is one of seven useful books I read on Parkinson's Disease","text":"For the past 14 years an extremely close friend of mine has had many unexplainable symptoms (lack of smell, muscle cramping, choking, extreme abdominal pain with nausea after eating fiber or fat-rich foods, etc.) This November 2015 I noticed a resting tremor in the arm on his left side. This was the first time I suspected his issues were related to one disease which might be Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, I still dismissed this possibility because tremors can be related to other medical issues (one of which is benign) and he has only had this tremor three times. Periodically over the past several months I noticed him walking slower, a frozen facial expression, and his right hand curled in front of him as if he had a stroke. On Dec 5, 2015 he really exhibited the slow walking, frozen face, and curled hand and he took forever to dress that morning. Later that evening I became certain (in my opinion) that he has PD due to his telling me about a change in his handwriting which I did not witness. Unfortunately, he refuses to go to the doctor or seek medical help from a neurologist even when I told him I believe he has PD. On extremely rare occasions he'll go to see a particular specialist for whatever ailment is almost killing him at the moment. As a result, since December 2015 I've completely immersed myself in learning about PD with some cursory investigation of illnesses that exhibit Parkinson-like symptoms because I wanted to be sure I was on the right track.<br \/><br \/>Besides searching the Internet for information, I purchased seven (7) books on Parkinson's Disease (PD) of which this book is one. My review is written from the perspective of someone who does not have PD but wants to learn about what the signs of PD are, what a person's life will be like, what are their challenges, what they should do about it, what is their life expectancy, etc. This book is in the list below. I've listed the books in the order of value to me and not in the order that I read them. I also put the copyright date of each book in parenthesis as well as my star ranking based on its usefulness to me and a short few sentences of what the book was about. If I had PD myself, I would rank them in a different order. I posted the same review to each one of these seven (7) books. At the end, I wrote a summary of what I think about PD and listed seven (7) other books I may one day buy and read.<br \/><br \/>[[ASIN:0470073950 Parkinson's Disease For Dummies]] (c 2007) (4.5 stars) - Although this book does not have the latest developments or information on PD or Lewy Body disease (dementia included), it was invaluable in helping me understand what PD is in the most simplest terms. It helped me understand what to look for in a person with PD and what challenges they face. Since we are in 2016, the information on treatment is somewhat outdated. This book is great for someone who suspects they have PD or just got diagnosed because it clarifies symptoms in easy-to-understand language. It's a great resource for the newly diagnosed PD patient and those preparing for their first appointment. It also has information on Young Onset Parkinson's Disease (YOPD) and a chapter (sections of which I skipped over) full of exercises for the PD patient.<br \/><br \/>[[ASIN:0446678902 What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM): Parkinson's Disease: A Holistic Program for Optimal Wellness]] (c Feb 2003) (4 stars) - This is like a textbook on Parkinson's disease with case studies from actual patients and information on alternative therapies such as acupuncture. This book appears to outline all the symptoms of Parkinson’s, including ones not in other books such as Seborrheic dermatitis and stuttering (which is also in Wilson's disease). This book discusses everything from A-Z, like complementary medicine (homeopathy, acupuncture, etc.), issues for caregivers, etc.  Case studies are interspersed throughout the text to give the reader a general idea of a PD person's experiences. It even mentions Mucuna pruriens which is a bean sold in supplement form and has high levels of levodopa that could be of help to PD patients--of course, only take this with supervision of your doctor.<br \/><br \/>[[ASIN:193260393X A Caregiver's Guide to Lewy Body Dementia]] (c 2011) (5 stars) - this broadened my horizons about PD because it described the symptoms related to two very similar diseases and was co-written by someone whose spouse had dementia with Lewy bodies. PD is a Lewy Body disease where abnormal proteins show up on the part of the brain that controls movement. However, it is closely associated with Lewy Body Dementia that has abnormal proteins on the cognition part of the brain.  Both diseases have many of the same symptoms and depending on which symptoms appear first that determines what the disease is called. It is either dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's Disease with Dementia (PDD). The diagnosis is critical because medications for one disease can have adverse effects on those with the other disease or on those with Alzheimer's. Some DLB patients are misdiagnosed with Alzheimer's and those medicines are contraindicated in most cases for them. It was this book that helped me realize the symptoms I was seeing was the same with my friend and also easily explained what a caregiver needs to do.<br \/><br \/>[[ASIN:1630261297 Living Well with Parkinson's]] (second edition) (c 1991, 2005) (5 stars) - This book was originally written by a woman who had Parkinson's Disease but who died on November 25, 1998 from a heart attack unrelated to PD. It was revised in 2005. This book is phenomenal in my opinion because it supplied me with an excellent narrative of what it was like to live with Parkinson's and how to make that life worth living. The chapter on &#34;Medications and Therapies&#34; provides a list of diseases that can resemble PD. The chapter on &#34;Is There Life With Parkinson's&#34; is a positive narrative on how the author lived very well with the disease.<br \/><br \/>[[ASIN:1478325844 Parkinson's Humor - Funny Stories about My Life with Parkinson's Disease]] (c2012) (4 stars) - is a lighthearted book written by someone who has PD. The book, although not very funny to me, educated me on what day-to-day life is like to live with PD. For instance, Beverly mentioned how sometimes she felt starched when describing the rigidity PD patients experienced. Except for [[ASIN:1630261297 Living Well with Parkinson's]], this book was the only other uplifting book.  All the others books were way too serious and sobering. At a time when I am new in trying to understand PD and PDD, reading a text like this or the one above was critical especially since I was overdosing on the subject. This book provided the mental break I needed, was slightly educational, and an extremely easy read.<br \/><br \/>[[ASIN:0671768190 Parkinson's Disease: The Complete Guide for Patients and Caregivers]] (c 1993) (3 stars) - this book is similar to [[ASIN:0446678902 What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM): Parkinson's Disease: A Holistic Program for Optimal Wellness]]  but it's 10 years earlier so the information is dated. For example in one chapter on how to cope with Parkinson’s there's a suggestion to use a Dictaphone if you can't write.  It has a short first section on symptoms of the disease and then goes into history, treatment, etc. There are three sections, however, that I found worthwhile. The Chapter on &#34;The A to Z Guide to Symptoms and Side Effects,&#34; &#34;Planning Your Financial Future,&#34; and &#34;Diseases That May Resemble Parkinson's Disease&#34; which is in the Appendix II are invaluable.  One thing I did not like about this book is that it was very negative describing more than once about the disabling effects of PD and how you have get your affairs in order, etc. Except for the three worthwhile chapters, I feel I did not need to purchase this book to get the information I was looking for.<br \/><br \/>[[ASIN:0374116172 Brain Storms: The Race to Unlock the Mysteries of Parkinson's Disease]] (c 2015) (4 stars) - the author is actually a PD patient and this book covers the most recent research on PD.  It was not as helpful to me because it talked more about the latest developments in the search for a cure as well a brief glimpse at tests and drugs for PD patients. If I were a person with PD, then this book would probably be second in value in my list. For me, I could have done without purchasing this book.<br \/><br \/>In summary, what I discovered is that a PD patient does not die from their disease and they can have a normal life expectancy. PD is a slowly progressive disease, that is not usually hereditary, and which affects each patient differently. Not all PD patients have visible tremors. The disease definitely changes the patient's life and the lives of those closest to them but it sometimes does this for the better because the patients re-evaluate their lives and how they want to spend their time. For many, the disease will be an inconvenience that the patients and caregivers can learn to live with. There are no tests that can definitely determine someone has PD while the person is alive. A definitive diagnosis can only be made with post-mortem brain analysis.  PD is determined via a process of elimination of testing for other similar diseases, observing arm muscle reactions during a test a doctor may try, and observing how the symptoms respond to Carbidopa \/ Levodopa drugs. It is critical that patients seek help immediately and partner with a doctor (or several doctors such as physical therapists, speech therapists, etc.) to seek a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan.  At the early stages of PD, no drug therapy may be involved; it might me more of a wait and see approach.  The positive attitude of the patient along with eating right, exercising, partnering with a healthcare team, and having a good support network provides the best outcome for the patient to have a fruitful life with only some limitations and modifications.<br \/><br \/>Please understand that no one book provided all the information I needed or wanted. I discovered information has to come from several sources, including the Internet and PD support groups. For instance, one PD symptom not mentioned in any of these books is gastroparesis. I found that one by searching the Internet with the word Parkinson's and abdominal cramping with nausea and the likes. I did these searches years ago, but at that time I did not suspect PD so Parkinson’s was not part of the search criteria. I do hope my friend will seek the help of a neurologist, detail all his symptoms, and let me tell the neurologist what I have been seeing.  Could I be wrong about believing that my friend has PD. Absolutely, I could be wrong; even doctors misdiagnose patients.  However, after reviewing Internet sources for the other diseases mentioned in these books, the only other diseases that come close with his symptoms are a brain tumor or Wilson's disease. However, with Wilson's disease his eye doctor would have noticed the copper ring (known as Kayser-Fleischer Ring) around his cornea during his eye exam.<br \/><br \/>Although I am on PD overload, below are seven (7) other books (not listed in any particular order) that I might purchase in the future to learn more. The first one is on a disease with very close PD symptoms and the other six are on PD or a person’s experience with PD.<br \/><br \/>1.

{"rating":4,"title":"Girl, Interrupted","text":"\"The Mirrored World\" by Debra Dean is a good introduction to the culture of upper class and royal life in the Russia of the 1700s.  Born into a minor titled family, Xenia is only about six when we first meet her.  She lives a conventional upper class life, doing essentially what is expected of her throughout her adolescence and in the early days of her marriage.  Unlike many women of her time, she marries for love, and she is blissfully happy at first.  The first half of the book covers this part of her life.<br \/><br \/>Xenia's happiness does not last long; two unexpected tragedies occur, throwing her first into deep mourning and then into a complete breakdown.  The second half of the book traces Xenia's transformation into a \"holy fool\" or a \"fool for Christ.\"  She sees the emptiness and transitory nature of earthly possessions and joys and relationships, and dedicates herself to service of the poorest of the poor.  While many saintly men and women have had just that sort of insight and made exactly that same service to the poor their life's work, Xenia goes to an extreme, to put it mildly.  We see Xenia's family try to help her, to no avail.<br \/><br \/>As I read this book, I could not help but think that one age's sanctity is another age's madness.  To me, Xenia seems truly to have lost contact with reality.  A religious person may say that she simply made contact with a greater reality, but I am not so sure.  I feel certain that if a person acted this way today, he or she would surely be institutionalized or at least treated with medication.<br \/><br \/>Xenia is a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church, and the book purports to show her path to sainthood.  It does this in lovely and often poetic language.  The descriptions of the Russian landscape and way of life among the upper classes were excellent, and I kept reading the book largely for the superb use of language.  But I doubt that Xenia is a saint for our times.  For that, check out Dorothy Day or Maximilian Kolbe.","images":[],"asin":"0061231452","parent_asin":"0061231452","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1342551819000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2005,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"more than a romance - a story of the last 8 years","text":"Set in Australia and New York City, politics and journalism. I picked this up to read after a rather lackluster book wondering if I was burnt out on reading, and then I didn't put it down or pause for 3 hours. By the end of the first chapter I was hooked. The only thing I would have liked would be for the main characters to get romantic earlier in the book because when they do it's very passionate and I thought they both deserved it after what they went through. Told with passion and humor and terrific writing.<br \/><br \/>41 year old Clancy's career as a financial journalist ends epicly in chapter one.(My only regret is not to have Martin and Jennifer show up later in the book).<br \/><br \/>It's 2008 and 32 year old Amanda McIntyre's career in finance (Yale - top of her class) is destroyed by the CEO's running corporations into the ground. She and her girlfriend Natalie have nothing in common, an open relationship and all they do is snipe at each other (they seem to have no respect for the other either). It gets worse when she gets back to her apartment after being let go from her job (I'd say more but that would be a huge spoiler). Let's just say that she had a terrible, horrible, awful, really bad day. Luckily she has one life line and that is her BFF Malcolm. The only turnoff for me is her actions at the holiday company party 3 months into her job - I'll chalk it up to the folly of youth as she was only 27.<br \/><br \/>Over a year earlier Clancy and Amanda met when both were on top of the world, Clancy with a hit book on the perils of the financial world and Amanda 2 years into a finance job that was paying her a cool million a year.

{"rating":4,"title":"Excellent, well-researched view of the women beside the men","text":"I definitely recommend this engaging and historically fair fictionalized story centered on the abolitionist John Brown's second wife, his daughters and daughters-in-law.  Although we learn about the various Brown children in general, Higginbotham focuses on Mary, on John Junior's wife Wealthy Hotchkiss Brown, and on the strong-minded Annie Brown. The facts of John Browns life are well known:  He had a huge family; he experienced modest successes and abject failures in trying to make a living; he traveled constantly, he was deeply religious and he was radically anti-slavery.  Ultimately, he turned to violence as a means of trying to end slavery in the US, first in Kansas, then at Harper's Ferry, Virginia.  He had four boys and one girl living when his first wife died.  Mary bore an additional six girls and seven boys. The Browns were close knit, valued education for girls as well as boys, were hard working and shared strong political and social views that led Mary to support John's activism and dangerous decisions while writing faithfully and keeping their farm going.  In a similarly strong marriage, Wealthy emigrated to Kansas with John Jr. and other family members, along with John Sr. who went in part to consider a move there and in part due to the political climate. The violence between those who wanted Kansas to be a free state and those who wanted it to be a slave state resulted in the destruction of all their property.  Some of the Brown's were involved in killing five pro-slavery men. John Jr. was imprisoned and tortured, then charged with  treason. We see first hand how Wealthy handles all their hardships and loss including her care for her husband during a complete mental breakdown.  Annie at 15 went with her pregnant sister-in-law Martha to a farmhouse in Maryland to help keep house for John Brown and the men he was recruiting for the raid at Harper's Ferry.  The intent was to make it look like a normal household\/farm, not just a household with a bunch of unrelated men.  The Black men that joined the group had to be hidden. Annie played a critical role of distracting and redirecting potentially suspicious neighbors.  Shortly before the raid, the two young women went home to New York state. This is a fast and satisfying read and captures the unusual and yet ordinary day to day lives of an extraordinary family, in particular the women.  John Brown is often portrayed as a caricature. His views and actions were certainly extreme even when presented in a factual rather than a sensational manner.  I appreciated Higginbotham's decision to show John Brown's humanity throughout this story, as well as her multi-dimensional portrayal of each of her primary subjects.  We often lose women in history.  To tell their stories, Higgenbotham made good choices on what to include from the voluminous amount information available on the Brown family. This is a novel, with imagined conversations and some characters that are made up, but it was refreshing that nothing central to their lives had to be made up about the women in this piece of historical fiction.","images":[],"asin":"1737474905","parent_asin":"1737474905","user_id":"AEZ26WGWJ3EOQ4KWSHG77HJAG4EA","timestamp":1641224741694,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3101,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Satisfying Mystery Involving Quintuplets, Government Conspirators","text":"A long-ago sibling rivalry has matured into a full-blown hatred.  An old collaboration has grown into a massive conspiracy that threatens the populace of Montreal, the politics of Quebec, and the stability of Canada itself.  In HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN, Chief Inspector Armande Gamache patiently investigates the long-hidden, underlying secrets behind a 70-year-old woman's murder, and a government worker's suicidal leap off Montreal's Champlain Bridge--a \"suicide\" that turns out to be murder after all.<br \/><br \/>In this book, Gamache is severely handicapped in his investigations by the dismantling of the homicide department of the Surete du Quebec.  Gamache still commands the department, but his highly successful homicide team has been broken up, on orders from his superior, Chief Superintendent Sylvain Francoeur.<br \/><br \/>Gamache's case begins when Myrna (a resident of the close-knit village of Three Pines) calls him regarding the disappearance of her friend Constance Pineault--who is the sole survivor of the famed Ouellet Quintuplets.  The Quints were little princesses who were given everything by the government of Quebec, but who grew into desperately lonely adults. Gamache's case ends with his old friends from Three Pines closing ranks to protect him from out-of-control government conspirators who want him dead.<br \/><br \/>As with other Gamache mysteries, the plot of HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN is quite complicated, but Louise Penny's writing skills make it easy for readers to track the simultaneous threads.  Even so, I found this ninth Gamache novel to be unusually slow-moving at times.  The Quints' story was interesting, but I guessed the ending fairly early.  The conspiracy story provided a satisfying conclusion to the La Grande hydroelectric dam story chronicled in [[ASIN:0312626908 Bury Your Dead]], but was tacked on and not particularly believable overall. However, this book is an absolute must-read for all fans of the excellent Chief Inspector Gamache series (which begins with [[ASIN:0312541538 Still Life]]).  Overall, I rate HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"0312655479","parent_asin":"0312655479","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1372804115000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2141,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"An engaging look at the immigrant experience","text":"American Girl's newest doll Rebecca Rubin lives in 1914 New York. Her parents and grandmother are Jewish immigrants from Russia, but Rebecca and her four brothers and sisters were born and raised in the US. In \"Meet Rebecca,\" we're introduced to Rebecca's family and Jewish home life. Rebecca's bubbe (grandmother) is very religious and her family observes Shabbos (the Sabbath), but her father must work on Saturday to make ends meet, which displeases her bubbe. Bubbe is also scandalized by the fact that Rebecca's cousin Max (Moyshe) is a struggling actor. Rebecca's passion is moving pictures; she adores the Perils of Pauline and longs to go to a real movie. Her cousin Max encourages her, and Rebecca tries out a performance of her own with unpredicatable results.<br \/><br \/>Rebecca always feels left out; her older twin sisters Sadie and Sophie always get to light the Sabbath candles and check the challah bread. Rebecca is desperate for her own set of candlesticks to prove that she knows the Hebrew blessing and is old enough to participate, and seeks to find a way to raise enough money.<br \/><br \/>There's also trouble back home in Russia, where her Uncle Jacob and his family are trapped. Their daughter Ana is very sick, and the Russian army is conscripting boys as young as twelve. Rebecca's father, a shoe salesman, struggles to raise the $175 it will take for steamer tickets for the family.<br \/><br \/>Judaism plays a central role in Rebecca's life, and the author does a good job of incorporating Jewish culture and traditions into the story (lighting the Sabbath candles, Sabbath restrictions, pushkes, mitzvahs, bar mitzvah). The immigrant experience is also central to the story, and Ellis Island is touched upon. I found it a bit unlikely that Rebecca's immigrant parents would speak mostly English at home; most likely, her parents and grandmother would continue to use Yiddish as the home language, with English being the school language.<br \/><br \/>The section on America in 1914 was particularly useful and included numerous bits of trivia about the conditions in Russia (pogroms), the immigrant experience in New York, Yiddish culture, and early movies and newsreels. There's also a glossary of Yiddish and Hebrew words. Overall, this is a nice introduction to American Girl's newest historical character and a good overview of the 20th-century immigrant experience that's accessible for younger readers.","images":[],"asin":"1593695217","parent_asin":"1593695217","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1246271603000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2433,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Pattern Collection With Historical Twist","text":"As a knitting history buff, I like this book a lot.  It's a pattern collection with a twist:  the patterns are inspired by knitting fashion eras.  Fashionable handknits and knitting fashion trends in each era (the roaring twenties, the glamorous thirties, the thrifty forties, the fabulous fifties, the swinging sixties, the groovy seventies, and the dramatic eighties) are described at the beginning of each era's chapter, and then illustrated with photos taken from the era's knitting pattern books.<br \/><br \/>What I particularly like, is the way that each garment pattern captures the flavor of its era.  For example, there is (1) a bed jacket from the forties, converted to a modern bolero (the cover photo), (2) a cloche hat from the twenties, complete with artificial flowers, (3) a beaded angora cardigan from the fifties, (4) an Aran cardigan from the sixties, (5)  a poncho from the seventies, and (6) a batwing sweater knit in glittery yarn from the eighties.  In addition, there are patterns for twinsets, headbands, a lacy accent collar, a Pucci bag, flapper and mini dresses, a Fair Isle vest, oversized pullovers, socks, and leg warmers.<br \/><br \/>The original patterns inspired by each era are updated in sizing and fit to accommodate current knitting fashion tastes.  Yarns used to knit the garments are all modern yarns that are  currently available (or an equivalent yarn is available).<br \/><br \/>Probably I'll never knit any of these patterns, but the garments are attractive.  Certainly the book is not a serious reference for knitting historians, but I enjoyed reading the historical text and looking at the photos.  Overall, I rate this book at 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4 stars (\"I like it\").","images":[],"asin":"0764146629","parent_asin":"0764146629","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1321674449000,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1719,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Wonderful Entry into a Series I will pick up and read from book 1 -Branson Missouri","text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this fifth entry in the Henry Worth series and plan to pick it up with book 1.  Hank is the elected county sheriff in Branson County, Missouri.  We quickly learn that three new recruits have been trained and are starting work in the wake of several employee terminations.  The department is deeply divided over a budgetary decision to allow no overtime, in order to maintain a full staff.  Hank's wife, Maggie is the ER doctor in town.  She has noticed that an unusually large number of older bus tourists have ended up in the hospital with dehydration and low blood sugar issues while attending some of the entertainment venues. Hank agrees to take a look at the issue.  Booth does a nice job weaving in department politics, the advancement and performance of various less experienced people and the new recruits, the Chief Deputy Sheriff's efforts to quietly keep a handle on how bad the remaining angry employees are making things for the newbies or less experienced folks, and in general, a character named Earl who is a civilian clerk with more common sense in his pinkie than most of the folks around him.  There is a murder, the victim not quite likable so we have a number of good suspects.  There is a bigwig that Hank has never cared for who he is sure is involved somehow.  There are the County Commissioners, with one anti-sheriff bozo and others not willing to adequately fund the department.  All in all it's a great cast of characters with some very original plot twists and some lessons on effective community policing and doing the right thing.  I was sleepy when I started the book.  Booth starts many sections of the book without identifying the character who we are reading about.  I had to go back and pick up her style but it was a very enjoyable technique once I read the whole book wide awake.","images":[],"asin":"0727823019","parent_asin":"0727823019","user_id":"AEZ26WGWJ3EOQ4KWSHG77HJAG4EA","timestamp":1652182363411,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1838,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Bitter and Sweet","text":"Schroder is told in first person as an apology of sorts, an explanation, of how a man can lie about who he is and one day be compelled to kidnap his own daughter. The narrator, Eric, has been described by many readers as unreliable, and I agree. He is, after all, a habitual liar and largely self-centered.<br \/>It's easy enough, though, to fall for his innocent charm. Because it does seem innocent; there doesn't seem to be any malice in any silly, foolish thing he does.<br \/><br \/>Beyond a character study of the narrator, Schroder is also a poignant, heartbreaking look at marriage and parenthood. At what each takes from us, and what each gives to us. Although it was difficult to relate to Eric himself, I could definitely identify with the emotional landscape he travels as a spouse and parent.<br \/><br \/>Gaige's writing is gorgeous, regularly described as lyrical, and flowing with phrases I wanted to underline. I will say that in following the narrator's eccentric mind, there are several instances of footnotes and asides, all of which I skipped. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5.<br \/><br \/>Otherwise, Schroder is a quick read and provides a compelling dive into a character's heart and mind. I think it's greatest impact for me was how deftly it combined both the bitter and sweet, and the message that through all of life's complications, love is the surest thing we hold on to.","images":[],"asin":"1455512133","parent_asin":"1455512133","user_id":"AGGHHNTNWUXUG2LEOP4KGUMULISQ","timestamp":1357911492000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1392,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"Perfect precursor to College ASL course...!!!!","text":"This is a great find and I’m so glad to have stumbled upon it prior to my daughter taking ASL classes this fall in college..!!<br \/><br \/>Learning a secondary language is difficult at best for most. Doing so, at a college level can add to the apprehension- BUT, when you top it off with 100% online COVID-19 class learning.. Let’s just say this kicks it up to the terrifying category!!<br \/><br \/>This book is great solution to our problem- it does a fantastic job of introducing the reader to the concept and idea of sign language itself. It shows the hand signs in both, visual and written instruction.<br \/>Of course, this includes the entire ASL alphabet which is a great thing to familiarize yourself with prior to embarking on a fast paced class course. But.. I love the inclusion of basic, common and frequently used phrases one is bound to need and know. ie. what time is it? Bathroom, food.. my name is- you get the idea.<br \/><br \/>This reference book is a great precursor to any beginning class.. As well as, being a helpful tool for anyone wanting to familiarize themselves and become more capable communicating with one who uses ASL. Love the fact, it officially is recognized as a secondary language- as, the ability to speak and understand is universal. This knowledge could prove beneficial in personal, social and even corporate business arenas- such a priceless asset and skill set we all should be more familiar with.<br \/><br \/> I am eternally grateful for all of the photos provided… The only struggle found, was photos are taken “straight on” from a 2D view. translation: it is hard to see position of ALL the fingers that are sometimes covered by the forefront placement of the hand or finger- making one a bit unsure of what the other digits should be doing\/forming.. If, other photos were included from different vantage points, it could clear up any confusion. (Reason for deducting 1 Star..) Over all, this one obstacle does not burden the reader significantly.<br \/><br \/>I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!","images":[],"asin":"1646119509","parent_asin":"1646119509","user_id":"AEIPJBAN7A55Q5DFFPZSR2UV3OKA","timestamp":1597288976356,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2049,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"This book may resonate with mothers who have lost a newborn, but not every reader will appreciate the story's chaotic style","text":"The author lost one of her premature twin sons shortly after birth and this book is about her loss. Her story and grief process is written in a chaotic style, many times fluttering from one thought to the next with limited cohesiveness. However, this chaotic thought process will probably resonate with those who have experienced the loss of a child, especially a newborn. Some of her story I could relate to even though I never lost a child. The reader will understand what it is like to experience thoughtless comments from those who know nothing of her misery or who want to avoid thinking about it because it causes them pain. I can relate because when my best friend (who also happened to be an ex-boyfriend) committed suicide by hanging himself in his bedroom, I was treated to thoughtless comments by others such as &#34;wow that must have been a high ceiling.&#34; Of course, there are those who react appropriately, but that is less often the case.<br \/><br \/>In summary, some mothers who have lost a newborn or young child will be able to truly feel that someone else has experienced what they are going through. However, not everyone will relate to the chaotic style in which this is written. It is not so much a succinct tale from beginning to end as it is several short stories with jumbled thoughts thrown in-between that really demonstrates the upheaval and utter sadness such a death imposes on the mother.","images":[],"asin":"1611805503","parent_asin":"1611805503","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1533082018883,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1422,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Wow.. this is a wild and colorful ride!!","text":"Wow!! and U-lala.. To bluntly put it, this is an adult rated version of a thought provoking “say it like it is” self look Inside, with deconstruction exercises and resurrection tools to look honestly in on ones self. That is the main focus-<br \/><br \/>No!! The language is not suited for younger readers in anyway. However, being the mom of college and high school age kids- I hate to say it and nor, do I agree\/disagree with it.. But, one can’t ignore in this day\/age language has strongly been desensitized… Like it or not, it has! I get shocked at what music is allowed to be made\/played- and sure! “They” tried explicit content labels- Ha! Little good that did,  once everything became available online.. Crazy, I remember madonnas “like a virgin“ and George Michaels “I want your sex” being banned from MTV and radio- My parents thought I was going to burn in hell for owning both these cassettes!! (Yes! I just gave away my 40something age..!!) But, with a generation that lovingly let’s girls call each other bitches and tiktok challenges that make you blush.. Or, music that doesn’t miss a titillating detail of whatever intimate act they’re rapping about- This is a generation that has redefined their offensive.<br \/><br \/>Whew.. I got that out! Tbh, foul language is just the avenue used to deliver the content- Ha! maybe it’s just to get us talking about an “unknown” book or, author. Or, possibly to set it apart from others..?!! Who knows but, it’s working!! (and they say- there’s no such thing as bad press! It’s still attention..)<br \/><br \/>So, let’s move past this and talk about the book!<br \/>Of course, this is a read\/workbook that could be helpful to women at any age- But, I truly feel it’s geared toward that 20\/30 something crowd..or, one who’s grown up with a deficit in their own self love\/confidence (this happens more then you think!!) it has a lot of: how to let go of negatives and be who you want to be.. be content with who you are-physically\/holistically. (I so appreciate the love + confidence it wants all women to find) This also addresses relationships from a “love yourself aspect.” It wants to build women up from any guilt, inferior or, doormat thinking.. When you combined all the above, along with the delivery style- it feels to aim toward young ladies stepping onto the stage of grownup life.. especially if, they’re not as sure on their feet as you want them to be. Having said that- certainly, any age could benefit, as it can be a useful tool for any who’ve made it to a mature phase of life.. but, were never part of a generation that supported\/empower women to self love. We’ve really seen a lot of action just in this decade to embrace this way of thinking. Self love has finally found its voice and is gaining momentum worldwide-<br \/><br \/>In my opinion, (self-help) or, as I like to call them..<br \/>“reflection or, self inventory books” fall into two categories. First, those with a lot of written insight and information and those that end each section with a quick self thought\/reflection opportunity. The second type feel more like an informational guided workbook.. A thought\/idea\/point of view gets shared and then, it puts reader to work!! Both approaches can be beneficial- it just depends on ones personality.. Some people are thinkers and reflectors- and prefer the written text with deep inner thought. While others are doers- and need to physically be engaged and become connected to the process- And as they describe their answers, they’re working toward the same place as the one who is reflecting..<br \/>This falls more in line with the second style- It guides one through the process of answering the questions one may not have asked themself.. and in turn, it can reveal a lot to the person doing the exercises. So, if purchasing for someone… just keep in mind- which type of process would be best suited for their personality.<br \/>This does not take things too deep while offering a good emotional exercise\/lift- in a funny and “cuss like a sailor” sort of way! This can even be a helpful “brush up” tool to remind a person and help regain positive focus in all that matters..  If, any of this sounds like a good fit to what you’re looking for- and you can handle the way the info. is presented.. this is a good purchase. Whew- Sorry so long winded.. But, I wanted to touch on all aspects!<br \/><br \/>I hope this info. helps.. feel free to let me know!","images":[],"asin":"1646115414","parent_asin":"1646115414","user_id":"AEIPJBAN7A55Q5DFFPZSR2UV3OKA","timestamp":1587708171315,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4426,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Orphan X Avenges Murder of Trainer Jack","text":"HELLBENT:  AN ORPHAN X NOVEL is the third entry in the Evan Smoak series (the first is [[ASIN:1250067847  Orphan X]]).  It works reasonably well as a standalone, but it’s best to start the series at the beginning.  The concept is all too believable—Smoak is Orphan X, one of a group of orphaned children who were recruited by the federal government and intensively trained as merciless killers used for secret, off-the-books operations.  Smoak opted out of the program (which marks him for death), and now operates independently as the “Nowhere Man”, helping innocent, ordinary people escape from terrible situations that the formal justice system can’t deal with.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, the evil head of the Orphan program (Van Sciver aka Orphan Y) is closer than ever to tracking Smoak down.  Van Sciver murders Smoak’s trainer and father figure (Jack), who knows he is about to die, but leaves a message for Smoak to get a package.  The package turns out to be a teen-aged former-Orphan-in-training (Joey), who washed out of the program.  Like Smoak, she is targeted for death; she would be dead already if Jack hadn’t found her and hidden her from Van Sciver.  Joey and Smoak team up to save another teen-aged Orphan, and to take out the 16 individuals who were involved in Jack’s murder.<br \/><br \/>This is a well-written thriller, with lots of action and plenty of plot twists that keep the reader turning the pages.  Smoak’s Orphan nemesis Candy also plays an important role.  This novel seems a little too long, as the action becomes repetitive (with 16 people for Smoak to dispatch).  However, fans of the series won’t be disappointed; I certainly enjoyed it.","images":[],"asin":"1250119170","parent_asin":"1250119170","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1513437734424,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1670,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Moral Militia!","text":"In this book, you'll find a futuristic America ruled militantly by a moralistic militia. No more democracy. Full force police state. The main character Ember is transported to a rehabilition facility. Rehabilitation for what? Being born out of wedlock. She becomes a ward of the new government.<br \/><br \/>I do wish the book moved a bit faster. It did drag a bit in some places. And I won't spoil the ending, but you'll see it coming way before you get there. You'll want to keep reading to know how Ember responds. The characters feel so real. I only wish Ms. Simmons would have delved into a few more details. I'd like to know more about the Sisters and the President. I'd like to know more about the attacks that brought about the police state. I'd like to know more about the Resistance. I'd like to know more about the Moral Militia- drafting procedures, training, etc.<br \/><br \/>I'd recommend reading it. If I had to compare it to other books, I'd lump it in with Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, and Matched. If you're a fan of any of those, give this one a read.<br \/><br \/>This is a good read. I guess since this is a young adult book, I'll give my usual parental blurb. References to sex outside of marriage, violence, suicide, andrape is alluded to. No bad language.

{"rating":4,"title":"A rousing blend of music and court intrigue","text":"\"The Musician's Daughter\" is a magical blend of the grandeur of 18th-century Vienna and the Esterhazy court, Haydn's lush string quartets, and the plight of the Romany (Gypsies). Fifteen-year-old Theresa Maria adores her father, a court violinist, and treasures his music lessons teaching her to play the viola. But her world is turned upside-down one Christmas Eve as her father is murdered, his beloved violin is missing, and he's wearing a strange golden medallion.<br \/><br \/>Theresa Maria, called Rezia by her friend Zoltan, is a strong female protagonist and struggles to hold her family together; her very pregnant mother is confined to bed, household finances are dangerously low, and her younger brother Toby is utterly bereft, crying himself to sleep every night. She draws upon hidden reserves of courage as she struggles to piece together the truth behind her father's murder and discovers that he was leading a secret life under their noses. This necessitates her placing herself in great physical danger in order to uncover  political schemes involving a treacherous relative.<br \/><br \/>Meanwhile, her love for the violin and music is nurtured by her godfather Franz Joseph Haydn, the court composer who is slowly losing his vision to cataracts. After her father's death, Haydn hires Rezia to copy his music as he composes it, and even allows her to play at a ball. At fifteen, she also experiences her first crush on Zoltan.<br \/><br \/>The gradually complicated web of lies, buried truths, and blackmail was well-paced, but I found the political elements overpowering to the musical ones; for a novel called The Musician's daughter, I was hoping for more passages devoted to the power of music in Theresa Maria's life, although there are several passages involving Gypsy musicians that are very evocative. Several of the plot elements, particularly the climax, seemed to come together a little too neatly after all of the danger and heartbreak involved, and the rushed final paragraph is either a mini time capsule of the narrator's future, or a lead-in to a potential sequel. Either way, the final paragraph felt far too rushed and might have been better dealt with as an epilogue.<br \/><br \/>The novel is aimed at readers age 12 and up, and the author Susanne Dunlap holds a PhD in music history, which lends this delightful period tale an air of authenticity. 18th-century Vienna is brought to vivid life through her shimmering descriptions of high fashion and the opulent palaces contrasting sharply with the poverty of the Romany camp. There is a strong message of social justice, racial tolerance and female empowerment unusual for the novel's time period. A reading guide or a \"who's who\" of 18th-century Vienna (or a brief history as to which characters were fictitious and which were based on actual historical figures) would have been helpful. Overall, this is an engaging read, particularly for young readers who love period dramas, music, or political intrigue.","images":[],"asin":"1599903326","parent_asin":"1599903326","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1228272156000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2989,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"Anecdotal Account of San Francisco Cheese Expert's Exploration of \"American Cheese\"","text":"Gordon Edgar, the author of CHEDDAR: A JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF AMERICA'S MOST ICONIC CHEESE is a cheesemonger (the highly knowledgeable retail cheese buyer for San Francisco's Rainbow Grocery Cooperative).  He is also a frequent judge of annual commercial &#34;best cheese&#34; competitions (especially goat cheese contests, as a California expert).  His book is an entertaining account of his visits to the plants of artisan and mass market manufacturers of &#34;American cheese&#34;.  That is, cheddar cheese--whether sold in traditional clothbound cheddar wheels, or in massive 640-lb. factory bricks that are untouched by human hands during the entire manufacturing process.<br \/><br \/>The book tells the reader a lot about the historical development of American cheddar cheese--including how the greedy practice of shipping &#34;filled milk cheese&#34; (cheddar  made with milk that has the butterfat skimmed off and replaced with vegetable oil or something else cheap) destroyed the early cheddar export business between the U.S. and England.  It explains how American cheesemakers' faith in science and scientific methods ultimately created the quintessential standard for &#34;American cheese&#34;--Velveeta!  Kraft Velveeta, made from pooled milk that is carefully processed with factory methods, is the ultimate &#34;always tastes the same&#34; cheddar, a cheddar that is manufactured for maximum profitability,  safety, and shelf life.<br \/><br \/>Although I would have liked to read (and see) more about the actual steps involved in the different methods of making cheddar, I thoroughly enjoyed the anecdotes about gassy, maggoty, moldy, and exploding wheels of natural, traditionally-made cheddar.  His accounts of judging cheese competitions are interesting.  Also, his political take on farms as factories is well-stated (and confined to a single chapter, so you can skip it if you have no taste for farm, cooperative, or cheese-making politics).<br \/><br \/>The lack of photographs--either of the many brand-name cheddars mentioned, or of the cheese-making plants and\/or processes--was a disappointment to me.  (The author explains that photographs were omitted to keep the price of the book low.  He also points out that photographs of the steps in cheddar cheese making are readily available on the Internet.)  However, without photographs of the cheese labels to help fix the makers' names in my memory, I cannot try to find the makers' great-sounding cheddars locally unless I want to make a lot of lists.<br \/><br \/>This book is a terrific advertisement for the cheese section of San Francisco's Rainbow Grocery Co-op (where the author is the retail cheese buyer).  I would love to stop in and purchase some of the current cheddar cheese selections (a blue cheddar would be fun to try!), because I'm persuaded that Edgar has intriguing tastes in cheddar cheese.  (Of course there won't be any Kraft Singles or Velveeta there.)<br \/><br \/>The book is well-researched, with good, often-amusing footnotes; and it has an excellent index.  Primarily because of the lack of photographs, I rate CHEDDAR at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1603585656","parent_asin":"1603585656","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1446752534000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3177,"length_group":3}

Orphaned after their father died, the girls are sent to live with their aunt in Australia. After growing up on the tropical paradise of Rongo, their new home Sydney, with its mad rush and choking pollution, is absolute torture, and Riko (known as Erika in the city) hatches a plot to escape.<br \/><br \/>Riko's idyllic summer on Rongo turns sour with the arrival of an American scientist, Henry Jacka, who's falling in love with Sif. Riko is bitter and upset, lashing out at those closest to her. She escapes up into the hills to vent to her friend Pig, a ground-dwelling Stone Age dwarf with an intense fear of fire.<br \/><br \/>The book inserts a dizzying blend of science fiction (telepathy, space age materials, mermaids, dwarves) and heavy-handed environmental warnings (mankind will destroy the earth!) into a relatively slim story; the main focus is on Riko's intense jealousy of Henry attempting to take Sif away from her. The climax felt forced and the sacrifice trivial; the ending fared better. This was originally written in 1986, and its age clearly shows in the descriptions of the \"near future\": rather than space-age technology, we get environmental disasters such as underwater dead zones, active volcanoes, tornadoes and floods, resulting in the death of butterflies (not quite yet!) and bees (much closer to reality).

{"rating":4,"title":"Feminist-Centered Plot Introduces Author’s New Detective","text":"FALL OF ANGELS (AN INSPECTOR REDFYRE MYSTERY) introduces Barbara Cleverly’s new detective, John Redfyre.  He’s sort of a cross between Inspector Lynley and Inspector Morse, because he’s a well-connected, educated policeman assigned to a university town (Cambridge).  Redfyre is unique, though, because his series is set in Cambridge of the 1920s.  Be warned that this is a “feminist” novel—the plot centers on a group of strong women who are working to achieve true equality after the 1918 grant of limited women’s suffrage in England.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, a female trumpeter (a highly controversial choice of musical instrument!) is nearly killed by a suspicious fall down the steep steps leading from the choir loft at the St. Barnabas College Chapel.  Redfyre is in attendance at the trumpeter’s ill-fated performance, and cordons off the area near the steps, treating it as a crime scene.  Soon enough, he discovers a second attempted murder of the trumpeter; and actual murders of various women who are loosely connected with the trumpeter follow shortly.<br \/><br \/>The novel is well-written, with fully developed characters and solid historical background.  I like Inspector Redfyre every bit as much as Joe Sandilands.  The plot of this novel leaves something to be desired, though.  It’s highly complex, with lots of unexpected twists and turns, and it has something of a surprise ending.  However, the story loses its momentum and begins to peter out in the last 75 or so pages, so that the ending is unsatisfying.  This is a good mystery\/thriller, but it’s definitely not Cleverly’s best.","images":[],"asin":"1616958766","parent_asin":"1616958766","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1525646958597,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1603,"length_group":3}

Kitty finds it hard to distance herself professionally; she's terminally star-struck at meeting Laird in person, so much so that she forgets to take notes (she's seen every film he starred in). But Kitty and Dex quickly dig up some unsavory truths on Laird's offscreen persona; an estranged wife, a jilted lover and several employees paint a less-than-glowing picture of a man with a hot temper and lusty appetites that know no boundaries.<br \/><br \/>The behind-the-scenes views of the 1930s-era film studios (and Production Code politics) are fascinating, and there's a moment of sheer comedic genius as Kitty goes undercover as an extra in a futuristic sci-fi film.

Be sure to check your Droid model before ordering:  this book covers the Motorola Droid 3, Motorola Droid X2, HTC Droid Incredible 2, and the Samsung Droid Charge.","images":[],"asin":"1118177649","parent_asin":"1118177649","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1360981690000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1290,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"More twists and turns than an Agatha Cristie novel","text":"This book was recommended to me by my brother. I added it to my ever-growing “to be read” list and forgot about it for a few weeks. Then, as if the book desperately wanted to be read, every shop that I went into there it was staring me in the face. Finally, I came across a copy in a second-hand shop and figured I had to get it.<br \/><br \/>This book grabs your attention from chapter one, or should I say, day one; seeing as the main protagonist Aiden will wake up each day as someone new. This got a bit confusing to start with and took me a while to get my head around the concept but by “day three” I was totally emersed and couldn’t put it down.<br \/><br \/>The book opens with a dark and rainy night in a forest where you are thrown into the action and introduced to the narrator, a man with amnesia; lost and alone in the woods and one name on his lips…”Anna”. The only problem is that he doesn’t know who this Anna is, no matter how much he wracks his brain. His friend? His wife? His daughter?<br \/><br \/>He glimpses a woman in a black dress, running for her life with a pursuer crashing through the foliage after her. He tries to chase after them but her cries for help are cut short but a gunshot that rings out in the darkness. He is too late. And so begins the incredibly original and unique “The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle”.<br \/><br \/>This book is full of more twists and turns than an Agatha Cristie novel. This is author Stuart Turton’s debut novel as I cannot wait to see what else he has up his magical sleeves.","images":[],"asin":"1492657964","parent_asin":"1492657964","user_id":"AEHWUHNTB5FX32HJ7UBOZ2WWUX3Q","timestamp":1584977860804,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1536,"length_group":3}

If you need something stolen from any star system in the Confederation, you need look no further than the Shades. Jeth Seagrave and his band of teenage mercenaries have been making a name for themselves for being able to steal anything--and for disappearing before anyone is the wiser. Their latest job, a jewel heist on Grakkus, should be no different.

Of the various star systems that make up the Confederation, most lie thousands of light years from First Earth--and out here, no one is free. The agencies that govern the Confederation are as corrupt as the crime bosses who patrol it, and power is held by anyone with enough greed and ruthlessness to claim it.

Jeth Seagrave and his crew of teenage mercenaries have survived in this world by stealing unsecured metatech, and they're damn good at it.

{"rating":4,"title":"Beware the haunted moors...","text":"\"Immortal\" is a contemporary Gothic novel that, well, tries too hard to be a Gothic novel by throwing in just about every convention in the genre (gloomy setting, Gothic architecture, omens, supernatural events, evil, controlling villains, check). Evie Johnson is sent to Wyldcliffe Abbey School after her grandmother suffers a stroke (Evie's mother died, and her father is a military officer stationed overseas). At sixteen, Evie has led a sheltered life growing up by the sea. Her first impression of Wyldcliffe isn't a promising one; forced to walk to the abbey in the rain after the cab driver refuses to take her to \"that cursed place,\" she's nearly run over by a mysterious, handsome, apparently consumptive man on a black horse.<br \/><br \/>When she arrives, Evie discovers that she's a charity case (I kept having flashbacks to \"A Little Princess\"). After an icy welcome from the school's queen bee, she finds out that she's expected to sleep in the bed of a dead girl. She's not allowed to have cell phones, iPods, or other electronics. The building is apparently haunted. Her only escape comes from her nighttime visits to the mysterious stranger, but fellow charity student Helen seems determined to keep Evie away from him, going as far as to earn her demerits (three demerits equals one very unpleasant punishment, which becomes more clear as the novel progresses).<br \/><br \/>The novel switches between Evie's first-person narration and that of Agnes's diary. I liked the idea of the diary, only it lessened the dramatic impact of the \"revelation\" dropped on page 268, which I'd figured out early into the story thanks to the foreshadowing. I did like how Evie's language in the present mirrored Agnes's diary entries, though, establishing a bond between them.  Wicca plays a large role, and I found the magic elements more engrossing than the \"romance\" between Evie and Sebastian. The descriptions of the various rituals and ingredients are described in detail. Dark magic and blood rituals are also explored towards the end of the novel, and I felt that those secondary characters involved in these activities were two-dimensional. The last third of the book, and the ending in particular, felt like it could have benefitted from more development; after long, slow passages, everything felt rushed.<br \/><br \/>Overall, a fairly quick read, but it seems geared towards a younger audience. Shields manages to evoke a creepy atmosphere full of secret societies and ghosts wandering the moors. Fans of magic, paranormal romance and Gothic novels will enjoy Immortal. The sequel, Betrayal, picks up where Immortal leaves off.","images":[],"asin":"0061375837","parent_asin":"0061375837","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1283301446000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2635,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"Excellent advice for educational coaches helping others evolve into great leaders except I am unable to visualize the how","text":"This is an excellent guide for guidance counselors and other coaches who need to help others evolve into great leaders. The take away for me is that great leaders must attain those skills not by being told what to do but by having them take part in the coaching process and being the ones who turn themselves into great leaders through effective coaching. It is important for those being coached not to be dismissed, ridiculed, etc. The coach must listen so that the coachee can grow. Evolving into a great leader is a lifelong journey both for the coach and the coachee.<br \/><br \/>This book also highlights that coaches should not be too tied to a specific outcome (from those they coach) because they may be met with resistance. A leader should remember to LEAD (listen, empathize, appreciate, design).<br \/><br \/>There is a lot of good advice in this book; however, to me it reads almost like a textbook. Although I enjoyed reading this (and I read it from cover to cover, even the Appendix), I feel this information is only one part of what is necessary to be an effective leader.

{"rating":4,"title":"4th in a mystery series reimagining of the life one of Britain’s most coveted painters - Francis Bacon","text":"Unlike the 3 earlier titles that were set in the 1940's, this title brings us a much younger re-imagined Francis Bacon pre-WW2 where he is still under his father's financial thumb and is banished by his father to Berlin for being his flagrant gay self, unbeknownst to the parental Bacon Francis has a gay old time. The author writes a very entertaining character and in a style that is delightfully readable.<br \/><br \/>Very entertainingly written -so much so that I am looking forward to read the first 2 titles in the series.<br \/><br \/>THE FIRES OF LONDON (2012) A killer takes refuge in the blacked-out streets of wartime London, upending the world of one of Britain’s greatest painters in this chilling and captivating re-imagining of the life of Francis Bacon. Francis Bacon walks the streets of World War II London, employed as a warden for the ARP to keep watch for activities that might tip off the Axis powers. Before the war, Bacon had travelled to Berlin and Paris picking up snatches of culture from a succession of middle-aged men charmed by his young face. Known for his flamboyant personal life and expensive taste, Bacon has returned home to live with his former nanny—who’s also his biggest collector—in a cramped bohemian apartment. But one night, death intrudes on his after-hours paradise. When a young man is found dead in the park, his head smashed in, Bacon and the rest of London’s demimonde realize that they have much more to fear than the faraway scream of war.<br \/><br \/>fyi the author has two more titles in the series set for publication &#34;In the second novel, Afternoons in Paris, now in production, Francis turns up in the City of Light, where an avant guarde theater troupe and some murderous Russian exiles keep him on the run.

One night, leaving a gambling club where he has run up a considerable tab, the young painter Francis Bacon, accompanied by his lover, sees a man gunned down in the street. They do what they can to stanch the flow of blood, but the Frenchman dies in the hospital. Soon afterward, Bacon receives a strange offer from the club owner: He will erase Bacon’s debts if the painter delivers a package to the dead man’s widow, Madame Renard, on the Riviera. What gambler could resist a trip to Monte Carlo? After handing over the parcel, Bacon learns that Madame Renard is dead—and the striking young woman who accepted the delivery is an impostor. The Riviera may be lovely, but in 1945, its sun-drenched beaches can be just as dark as the back alleys of London<br \/><br \/>MOON OVER TANGIER (2014) In colonial Morocco, a painter navigates a conspiracy of forgery, corruption, and murder.  For Francis, life with David grows more dangerous by the day. When sober, he is charming, but when he drinks, he is violent, slashing Francis’s paintings and threatening to gut the painter, too. When David leaves London for Morocco, Francis cannot help but follow this man whom he loves but can no longer trust. In Tangier, they find a thriving community of expats who guzzle champagne while revolutionaries gather in the desert. But in Morocco’s International Zone, death does not wait for rebellion.  After Francis identifies a friend’s Picasso as a fake, the police call him in to investigate the forger’s demise. If he refuses, they will throw David in jail, where inmates and the DTs will kill him within the week. Between the bustle of the city and the emptiness of the desert, Francis finds that in Morocco, even the fakes can be worth killing for.","images":[],"asin":"1504026160","parent_asin":"1504026160","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1450510083000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3696,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Excellent Continuation of “Children’s House” Series","text":"THE RECKONING:  A THRILLER is the second novel in the “Children’s House” series by Scandinavian author Yrsa Sigurdardottir.  The translation is excellent, though I found the plot slightly hard to follow on account of the unfamiliar Scandinavian names of the various characters.  (There is a list of the characters by name, with a pronunciation guide, at the front of the book.)<br \/><br \/>The novel is a police procedural, with Detective Huldar and Child Psychologist Freyja tasked with investigating an odd letter found in a schoolchildren’s time capsule.  In the letter, one unknown child listed six people that he intends to kill.  Ultimately, Huldar and Freyja’s investigation leads them to solving a cold case that involved the mysterious disappearance of an 8-year-old schoolgirl (Vaka).<br \/><br \/>The novel works as a standalone, but it’s best for a new reader to begin with the first one in the series, [[ASIN:1250308380 The Legacy]].  Otherwise the reader won’t understand the complex relationship that exists between Huldar and Freyja.  (The series takes its name from Freyja’s place of employment, a child protection agency called the Children’s House.)<br \/><br \/>The novel isn’t exactly a page-turner, but it’s well-plotted, with a lot of unexpected twists.

{"rating":4,"title":"A Good, Fast-Paced Mystery","text":"Anyone who reads &#34;She's Not There&#34; will instantly be reminded of the Madeleine McCann kidnapping in Portugal in 2007.  The set-up is almost exactly the same:  upscale hotel resort, upper middle class parents, child left in hotel room sleeping as parents have dinner in the hotel restaurant, child is abducted, parents are blamed without evidence, child is never found.  The spin in this novel is to fast forward 15 years from a similar event, revisit all the characters, and see what effect this abduction has had on everyone involved.<br \/><br \/>The main character is Caroline Shipley, the mother whose two-year-old, Samantha, is abducted.  Caroline's life has been shattered and her marriage has ended.  Her other child, Michelle, a prickly pear of a daughter, is almost constantly at odds with her, and Caroline is desperate to repair that relationship.  Caroline's ex-husband has some redeeming qualities but is most memorable for his philandering ways.  I can't decide if Caroline's mother is a sociopath or just a narcissist: she has one decent moment in the entire book, and it comes near the end.  Other characters include Peggy, the most decent and loyal character in the book, and Samantha herself, now 17, who contacts Caroline  after having seen artists' renderings of what the abducted toddler might look like in the present.  Once she finally shows up, Samantha is unfailingly decent, charming, and mature beyond her years.<br \/><br \/>The book is structured so that it alternates between the present and past, with some chapters taking place 15 years ago; others 6 years ago, and still others 5 years ago.  With one exception, the chapters in the last 40% of the book take place in the present, and the mystery of who took Samantha and why is finally unraveled.  The  book is narrated from Caroline's point of view, with the exception of one chapter near the end, which switches to an omniscient point of view so that the reader can &#34;get inside the head&#34; of each of the main characters.  This book is exceptionally fast-moving and plot-driven.  I found the characters a bit one-dimensional and the dialogue unrealistic at times, but the events of the novel move along swiftly.  Few will guess the outcome, but there is a lot of foreshadowing along the way, and if you review the novel a second time, you'll find it.<br \/><br \/>I know that some are calling this a psychological novel, but I would not.  It is not psychologically deep enough for that.  Rather, I would call it an old fashioned crime novel, one that I could easily see being made into a movie.  I read this book in two days--it flows and moves along very fast.  It is an easy read; some would call it a beach book.  I recommend it for those who enjoy crime novels with a bit of family drama thrown in for good measure.  Just don't expect to find too much depth or subtlety.","images":[],"asin":"1101966874","parent_asin":"1101966874","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1456079521000,"helpful_vote":19,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2867,"length_group":3}

I do appreciate how the author handled both the transgender and bipolar worlds, but I felt a little let down by the climax.  For much of the book the dilemna was whether Lily would get her hormone replacement treatments which seemed a little repetitive, but authentic. I guess what I really didn't like was that the climax which I won't give a spoiler, but the two main characters come together in a public venue to show support for each other.  But for me, that seems to be when the stressors would truly start.  That is the point where they would start feeling even stronger cultural pressures.  I do see that there was a bravery in it, and it is a place to stop at the change of openess, but I feel cheated to not know the reaction from that point on.<br \/><br \/>OK, that all seems a little too harsh, because the book is decently written.  It broaches two taboo subjects in one book and does it with respect and care.  I just feel left wanting for more. It seemed like an easy place to end a book. Perhaps that is good too though.

{"rating":4,"title":"A celebration of food from land and sea","text":"I’ve been blessed to teach hundreds of students from the Middle East, who generously shared their culture, cuisine and stories over tiny porcelain cups of cardamom-scented Arabic coffee, dates from royal orchards, and rosewater-soaked pastries, and “Baladi” captures the essence of Palestine in a beautifully tangible way that pays tributes to Palestine’s farmers, fishermen, bakers, market sellers, and ordinary daily family life – you will certainly want to add this to your cookbook collection and it is one of my top cookbooks of 2018.<br \/><br \/>I previously reviewed Joudie Kalla’s love song “Palestine on a Plate” in January 2017 when I quickly fell in love with the brilliant recipes and remembrances of her family’s kitchen. In her sophomore “Baladi: Palestine: A Celebration of Food from Land and Sea,” Joudie again pays homage to her homeland of Palestine, this time by taking readers to small villages, farms, orchards, markets and experiencing the changing seasons and various cuisines.<br \/><br \/>The word “Baladi” means “My home, my land, my country.” Despite its small size, Palestine is home to a wide range of terrains, including uninhabited desert and cold areas along the northern border, with access to the sea and rivers as well as an abundance of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs. Because of its prime location on a trade route crossing multiple borders, there are also other international influences on Palestinian cuisine which “makes us all family in the end.”<br \/><br \/>Market life is central to traditional Palestinian culture and dictates the day’s menu, as many still shop daily and buy whatever is freshest. In the market chapter, you’ll find turmeric mlik with cracked cardamom pods, Arabic coffee, the incredibly simple yet indulgent grape molasses and tahini spread (the Palestinian equivalent to the PB&J of our youth!), the fantastic fryup of grilled halloumi, fried eggs, and roasted tomatoes, mixed vegetable salad with tahini dressing, soft-boiled eggs with yogurt, chili and lemon, fried eggplant slices with honey and tahini, watermelon, feta and red onion with mint, and hummus (the entire first chapter is basically a vegetarian’s dream menu).<br \/><br \/>“The Fields and Earth” offers up an abundant harvest of veggies served every way: fried okra with chili, roasted beets,  sautéed, caramelized (the caramelized shallots with herby labneh was a revelation!), served kubbeh-style, fresh salads (goat cheese, dates, and endives pair spectacularly), and lemon potatoes.<br \/><br \/>s a baker at heart, my heart sang at the wide range of stuffed pastries and homemade breads like khubez (pita), Mai’s Akkawi Bread liberally coated in za’atar and stuffed with salty white cheese, za’atar and feta brioche twists, fatayer, and dumplings.<br \/><br \/>“The farm” delights meat eaters with ample recipes for lamb and poultry, while the seas and rivers offer arak-poached salmon, marinated sardines, shatta-marinated sea bass with crushed rose petals, fish skewers, fried fish, and kataifi-wrapped shrimp.<br \/><br \/>“Hills and orchards” uses the abundance of the harvest to create watermelon juice with mint and orange blossom (I got hooked on fresh watermelon juice living in Taiwan, and there is no better cure for summer heat and humidity), fresh pomegranate and mango juice, strawberry, orange blossom, and rose jam, apple and pistachio jam, preserved lemons, pickled olives, baklawa, filo pastries filled with sweetened cream, rose and pistachio eclairs, the endangered tamriyeh, khafeh cheesecake, pistachio, zucchini, and lemon cake, black sesame cake, chocolate and labneh cake with slivered pistachios, qatayef, tahini halva, and gorgeous, dramatic ice cream roulades.<br \/><br \/>Recipe names are given in English and Arabic in both metric and US measurements.<br \/><br \/>The book is illustrated throughout with luscious food photography by Jamie Orlando Smith, stunning photography of Palestine’s diverse landscapes as well as scenes from daily life (working the farm, pulling noodles, carrying in the day’s catch), gorgeous table settings, and Palestinian embroidery.

{"rating":4,"title":"Interesting","text":"This former Goldman Sachs insider employee, Steven Mandis, does a very good job in presenting both the history of the firm and how it changed.<br \/><br \/>Founded over a hundred years ago as a partnership, partners had the same values, extremely ethical, basically to care most for the customers and think \"long-term greedy\" so that if the customers were treated well and the customers knew that, the partners would do well even if the film would sacrifice profits in the short term to please the customers. And, as a partnership, the partners were personally liable, so that all the partners' money was at risk, not just their money in the firm, but their personal assets also, therefore creating an environment of trust between partners and customers.<br \/><br \/>So, a culture of both high ethical values and high profits created a renowned culture, so much so, the firm was able to easily recruit the best talent where each new recruit strove to be a partner. It created a real team approach, everything for the customers and all employees.<br \/><br \/>The author described how that once proud culture didn't change overnight or dramatically over time, but \"drifted.\"<br \/><br \/>The drift began when the firm, around the 1980's changed to a limited partnership, LLC, so that only the partners' assets held at the firm were at risk. This change happened as competition grew and instead of concentrating on things like mergers and acquisitions, and financing for such deals - investment banking functions, expanded into where really big profits were, propriety trading. The industry had metastasized, so Goldman Sachs risked not attracting big clients.<br \/><br \/>Then, in 1999 the firm went public, with an IPO, the last major investment bank to do so. Now, the firm had a priority to shareholders first, clients second even though the firm still had fiduciary responsibilities to them. Plus, the partners no longer had much liability. So, the firm was now more concerned with following just legal responsibilities, making it harder to follow just high ethical standards with clients, as public companies were required to treat shareholders first, plus have a short term outlook, rather than the former long term outlook. Also, as the company became more complex, compensation policies changed, therefore less of a team approach.<br \/><br \/>The author is perhaps most critical of Jon Corzine and Lloyd Blankfien in transforming the firm around this time, to making it competitive with the other companies especially with propriety trading.But, there still was much of that previous culture around, almost religious, so much so, the employees believed so even if not as true anymore. So, the firm \"drifted,\" still maybe a cut ahead of the competition on ethics and reputation. It did survive the 2008 financial crash, but needed help. Also, this drift happened at other firms and really a warning to all about the industry.<br \/><br \/>Some points also from the book:<br \/><br \/>1. After the crash it was revealed in an email some securities sold to clients were \"s***y.'<br \/><br \/>2. Goldman Sachs always did have a commitment to public service, part of its culture of a sense of higher purpose, and thus around 1979 many former employees went to work for the federal government.  This did have the effect of expanding the firm's powerful network.<br \/><br \/>3. Part of the firm's rationalizations that it's shareholder responsibilities didn't really hurt clients is that they considered the clients \"big boys\" and were aware of the new risks.<br \/><br \/>4. Goldman did branch out into asset management in 1928 with closed end trust funds, which cratered with the 1929 crash and Goldman did close down for a time.<br \/><br \/>5. In 2012, in an Op Ed, former employee, Greg Smith, called the culture at Goldman \"toxic,\" specifically blaming CEO Blankfein and president Gary Cohn.<br \/><br \/>6. Since teamwork was so important to Goldman originally, it strove to recruit those with team sports, military and public service backgrounds.<br \/><br \/>7. As competition grew, Goldman expanded internationally, even taking on some questionable clients like the Libya sovereign wealth fund.<br \/><br \/>8. Goldman was accused of its privileged position of trust  and confidentiality regarding its bailout of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM).<br \/><br \/>9. In 2003, Goldman settled charges by the SEC for conflicts of interest by research analysts by paying $110M in fines, because of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed in 2002.<br \/><br \/>10. Beginning in 1999, Goldman's board of directors had some outside directors, so less knowledge of inside workings of the company.<br \/><br \/>11. It is debatable whether Goldman could have survived the 2008 financial crash without help from the government.<br \/><br \/>12 In 2006, Goldman was betting against mortgage bonds it was selling to clients, resulting in a fine.<br \/><br \/>13. The author counted negative and positive articles about Goldman in the NY Times from 1980-2012, and found more positive before 2007 and more negative after 2007. Most of the negative articles after 2007 dealt with conflicts with clients and connections to the government.<br \/><br \/>14. A former employee, Greg Smith, mentioned above, wrote a scathing Op Ed, criticizing Goldman with treating clients as \"Muppets.\"<br \/><br \/>15. Goldman spent over $15M lobbying Dodd-Frank.<br \/><br \/>In conclusion, Goldman's culture drifted over time, less to welfare of its clients and more to welfare of it. All the while, even current employees felt they were serving a higher purpose, based on original culture. Meanwhile, clients still seemed to prefer Goldman because it was better than its competition, not a very good testimony to the industry.","images":[],"asin":"1422194191","parent_asin":"1422194191","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1389730306000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":5753,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"A 200-Pattern Basic Stitch Collection With Minimal Author Commentary","text":"MELISSA LEAPMAN’S INDISPENSABLE STITCH COLLECTION FOR CROCHETERS is a basic crochet stitch dictionary containing about 200 patterns grouped into six sections:  (1) Simple Solid Patterns, (2) Shell and Fan Stitch Patterns, (3) Openwork and Lace Patterns, (4) Textured Patterns, (5) Colorwork Patterns, and (6) Edgings.  For each pattern, there are written-out instructions, charted instructions, and a color photo showing a crocheted sample of the pattern.<br \/><br \/>Because I’m a big Melissa Leapman fan, I was looking forward to this collection of her personal favorite crochet patterns.  However, Melissa does NOT include any personal commentary on the individual patterns (e.g., why she likes the pattern, how or where she has used the pattern, etc.).  In a brief introduction, Leapman states:  “This collection includes 200 of my favorite crochet stitch patterns gathered from nearly thirty years designing for the yarn and fashion industry.  Some patterns are long-standing favorites, such as Solid Shell Stitch on page 18; others, like the Saxon Braid Panel on page 99 are original to this collection.”  As far as I can tell, Leapman does not otherwise indicate which patterns are old, and which are new.<br \/><br \/>The book provides a good selection of stitches for new crocheters, and is a good standby reference for experienced crocheters, but it doesn’t go very far beyond the stitch collections generally found in how-to books on crocheting (e.g., [[ASIN:156477998X A to Z of Crochet: The Ultimate Guide for the Beginner to Advanced Crocheter]]).  If you’re looking for a more complete crochet stitch dictionary, you might consider [[ASIN:1454701374 The Complete Book of Crochet Stitch Designs: 500 Classic & Original Patterns]]), and the other two titles in the Linda Schapper series.<br \/><br \/>Because the book has only 200 patterns, and lacks commentary by the author regarding their selection for inclusion, I rate MELISSA LEAPMAN’S INDISPENSABLE STITCH COLLECTION FOR CROCHETERS at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"1589239296","parent_asin":"1589239296","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1469564377000,"helpful_vote":39,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2059,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"A feast for the eyes (and imagination!)","text":"François Payard is a third-generation pastry chef (his grandfather owned an acclaimed shop on the Riviera, Au Nid des Friandises) with a string of eponymous bistros as well as a chocolate bar. His gorgeous plated desserts capture the essence of seasonal ingredients in complementary pairings. His philosophy is in using only as many ingredients as are necessary and no more; a great dessert should reflect \"the subtle interplay of flavor, texture  and temperature, along with a streamlined presentation that conceals its complexity.\"<br \/><br \/>This gorgeous volume is clearly aimed at professional chefs (the serving yield is frequently 6-8 servings, and many of the desserts can't be held after assembling) as well as very ambitious home bakers (I would put myself in the latter category). Many of the recipes have multiple components that will need to be prepared \/ assembled in advance, and like any professional pastry book, a large number of special supplies are required (acetate sheets, chocolate sprayer, whipped cream canister with N20 chargers for creating molecular gastronomy foams, etc.). Similarly, many recipes call for specialty ingredients such as licorice powder, passion fruit puree, pistachio paste, hyssop, silver grade gelatin, etc.<br \/><br \/>The desserts, divided into frozen desserts, fruit desserts, pastries, custards, tarts, and crepes, soufflés and other desserts, are a combination of classical French pastry (vacherin, charlotte, napoleon, apple tatin, tuiles) married to Asian and tropical flavors (star anise, tempura, lemongrass, pineapple). Fresh, seasonal fruit is truly the star, as many recipes call for poached pears, quinces, roasted summer apricots, poached winter fruits, etc. (it would have been helpful to also have a quick index of recipes by season, as there is such an emphasis on seasonal produce for maximum effect). The basic recipes for various base sauces, creams, tuiles, garnishes etc. are straightforward; I liked his take on the chocolate tart dough, which uses a combination of all-purpose and almond flour to add a touch of flaky crispness. Some of the techniques could have benefitted from additional photos, such as the patterned tuile loops on page 27; I had a hard time picturing the steps and had to refer back to the plated photo before I finally \"got\" it (I had to rely on my standby [[ASIN:0471359254 The Professional Pastry Chef: Fundamentals of Baking and Pastry, 4th Edition]] and [[ASIN:0471359262 The Advanced Professional Pastry Chef]] a couple of times for a refresher on technique and plated desserts).<br \/><br \/>Overall, there are plenty of beautiful, delicious pairings to inspire budding pastry chefs; I particularly enjoyed the chocolate shell filled with coconut sorbet and star anise sabayon and the many creative interpretations of cheesecakes and cheese tarts paired with marmalades and roasted fruits, as well as Payard's ideas for the cheese course, including black olive macarons with Gorgonzola ice cream, apple tatin with aged white cheddar cheese, and feta cheesecake with red wine-poached dates. Even if you never make a single dessert, it is a feast for the eyes (and imagination), and the base recipes such as the caramel balsamic sauce, basil oil, and spiced fig pulp, will surely find their way into my kitchen in one form or another!","images":[],"asin":"1118435893","parent_asin":"1118435893","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1379984559000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3329,"length_group":3}

There are laugh-out-loud moments to be found here, but Barry banks more on the nostalgia factor of a bygone era and familiar set pieces (the charming alternative lyrics to \"We Three Kings\" involving a rubber cigar) to create a \"Christmas Story\" mood of a dysfunctional suburban Christmas.<br \/><br \/>For us grownups, this is a pleasant jaunt down memory lane that's sure to delight Dave Barry fans and any of us who need a little Christmas spirit to brighten our day.

{"rating":4,"title":"FBI Agents Investigate Serial Murders of Female Train Hoppers","text":"THE FORGOTTEN GIRLS is the sixth “Stevens and Windermere” novel (the first is [[ASIN:B005GSZJ9I The Professionals]]), and it works fine as a standalone. It's inspired by the all-too-real Vancouver murders of some 49 “throwaway” women (mostly prostitutes and women of Native descent).  It was known that women were vanishing from the Downtown Eastside, but the police and city ignored the problem for far too many years.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, FBI agents Kirk Stevens and Carla Windermere are assigned to investigate an oddball murder--a photo of a brutally beaten woman has shown up without warning on a tractor salesman’s cellphone (a replacement for a stolen one--tech-savvy folks will know where the photo could have come from).  The woman's body had already been recovered from an Idaho snowdrift near the Northwestern Railroad’s “High Line”--a stretch of track known to itinerant “train hoppers” as one where female drifters riding alone tended to disappear.<br \/><br \/>The agents end up in Butcher’s Creek, Idaho, a tiny stop for railroad crews, where they encounter the local rumors about all the missing women (mostly waitresses and train hoppers) who are believed to be victims of a man who rides the freight trains on the High Line.  While Stevens and Windermere are in Idaho, they investigate a new murder, and then the disappearance of another woman--that they may possibly be in time to save.<br \/><br \/>The story's setting is along the railroad tracks that run from Chicago to Spokane, near the U.S.-Canadian border.  The book is slow-moving--and even a little confusing--at times, but the plot has unexpected twists, and the exploration of why multiple deaths of certain classes of women may go unnoticed and never investigated is interesting in its own right.<br \/><br \/>Stevens and Windermere are a likeable pair, and the series books are always entertaining.  This one had a bonus element for me, because I love trains, and particularly enjoyed the details about train hopping, and the mystery of how the murderous rider was able to hop trains in the winter without freezing to death.","images":[],"asin":"0399174559","parent_asin":"0399174559","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1491184433000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2104,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"A Good Overview of a Great Man","text":"I've read a lot of Alaska mountaineering books and stories over the years, and this book stands with the best for readability and holding interest. And since there are no modern climbing books that fail to mention Washburn's accomplishments, I was happy to get my hands on a new biography about the legendary climber. He truly pioneered Alaskan Climbing with the use of glacier landings and air drops to bringing a more alpine style of climbing to the state.<br \/><br \/>For the most part I am very happy with this book.  It was a great read that I never found tiresome.  However, I have to think that it might be harder for someone who is new to the climbing world to get into.  The book is written from an insider from the clique-ish world of climbers, which leads to a lot of name dropping and side stories.  Each story in itself is interesting, but when the names loop back it tends to get a little confusing and overwhelming.  I definitely felt I had an advantage by having read a number of other climbing books first.  The author does a reasonable job of introducing the names, but it is a lot to digest at one time<br \/><br \/>Probably the best thing a biography can do is give a sense of the person.  In that, I don't feel that the book put me inside Washburn's head, but I did get a strong sense of what it was like to be in his presence.  The author builds a strong portrait of his character - driven and stubborn but also wonderfully sharing with his knowledge.  I can see why he reached the top of Denali three times and I am so happy below 5000 feet. The worst thing a biographer can do is deify his subject which I think the author steered clear of.  He is free with pointing out shortfalls but paints a likeable portrait that seems to ring true while reading.<br \/><br \/>Toward the end of the book there were a few episodes that seemed to be forced in, from a family scandal to what may be a few too many of the author's personal climbing stories. However as a whole the book was well worth the read.","images":[],"asin":"0061560944","parent_asin":"0061560944","user_id":"AGLQQCIS5V6EGUCS5SSNHWZHQM6Q","timestamp":1246684366000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2013,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Lots of Illustration; Easy to Read; Seems Comprehensive","text":"Full of very colorful illustrations and easy to read type.  Starts with the basics of Windows 8 and covers many different topics.  If you go through the whole book, you should be somewhat of a Windows 8 expert.  Starts very basic and mentions things that are helpful even if you never used a computer before.  Even with very basic information, it doesn't feel like it is \"dumbed-down\", so even those who have used Windows for years will still be able to make good use of the book to understand how Windows 8 works and how different it is than prior versions.  The book probably was written from early releases or a BETA version, as it talks about things you can do with Media Center (such as playing a DVD).  From what I know, Media Center was not initially part of the Win 8 release and is a separate add-on.  I believe Media Center may be included now, as least in the downloaded Win 8 version, but I am not sure it installs automatically; the book makes it sound as if it is an integrated part of Win 8.  Since I don't actually have Windows 8 yet, I couldn't verify the accuracy of other information in the book.  I got the book thinking I was going to upgrade one of my computers, but then found out the hardware can't handle a Win 8 upgrade.  The only real problem I have with the book is that it won't stay open by itself so that you can refer back and forth from computer to book or book to computer. A spiral binding would have been preferable.  Other than a few possible inaccuracies and the problem with the binding, I really think you will like this book.  Has a good index in the back.  Total of 340 pages, packed with information on how to get up and running with Windows 8.  Save the cost of a training course and buy the book.  I believe anyone can learn Windows 8 from this book.

{"rating":4,"title":"Excellent healthy recipes; wish there were more pictures; 1\/3 of book is dedicated to meal plans","text":"I ordered this book because the cover contains pictures of healthy ingredients that I am drawn to. I have  not been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) but am wondering if I have it after reading this, especially as it relates to bloating. This diet is suppose to \"provide relief from bloating, abdominal pain or discomfort, constipation, and diarrhea in up to three out of four people with IBS.\"<br \/><br \/>FODMAP stands for fermentable, oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyol which really describes a \"group of rapidly fermenting carbohydrates\" that are hard to digest. The idea behind the diet is to be on it for a while and then introduce hi-FODMAP ingredients into the mix to see which produce symptoms. It is not a diet to eat for life.<br \/><br \/>In the beginning chapters there is a list of low, moderate, and high FODMAP ingredients as well as a four-week meal plan. The recipe section starts a third into the book.<br \/><br \/>My purpose in ordering this book was to add another cookbook to my library from which I could make some healthy meals. I was correct about my assumption that there are a lot of healthy recipes within and in this regard this book is perfect for me. I do not mind that they are low-FODMAP. There are over 19 recipes I would try. There are 3 recipes I did try in less than 24 hours and they came out excellent. In addition, they were not time consuming to make as most recipes I have made from other books.<br \/><br \/>I made the Cranberry-Quinoa Salad (w\/o the cranberry vinaigrette), the broccoli and cheese frittata, and the olive lover's hummus. My boyfriend ate the first two items with me and loved it as well. He was not around when I made the third. Although the hummus did not look good, the taste was exceptional.<br \/><br \/>There are only three disappointments I have with this book. First, I was extremely disappointed that the acronym FODMAP was not spelled out until Page 10.  Acronyms should always be spelled out during first use even if one is not likely to understand them.  Second, only the start of each chapter has pictures and no pictues accompany the recipes.  Third, there is some fluff in this book with shopping lists and pantry staples.<br \/><br \/>In summary, I love this cookbook for the healthy recipes. The three recipes I tried were extremely flavorful and easy to make from start to finish. I do not follow meal plans, so I cannot vouch if this plan works or not. However, for someone who wants to follow this plan, then be prepared to be dedicated.  The four-week meal plan may require you to make most (if not all) of the recipes in this book morning, noon, and night with two snacks. If this had many more pictures and spelled out FODMAP at the beginning, it would have received 5 stars from me.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71IU0vWGxAL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71IU0vWGxAL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71IU0vWGxAL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71KG0V7G+rL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71KG0V7G+rL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71KG0V7G+rL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71T4ClTCVBL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71T4ClTCVBL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71T4ClTCVBL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71qc14pPjFL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71qc14pPjFL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71qc14pPjFL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1641528869","parent_asin":"1641528869","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1580170993774,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2791,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"The Wisdom of Our Elders","text":"I liked this &#34;we can employ ordinary measures for mood improvement and to fight against anxiety, depression, and stress. My conclusion from working with nursing home residents is that feeling better does not usually require a miracle, just careful management of the mundane elements of our lives.&#34;<br \/><br \/>Dr Dodgen is a breath of fresh air, he has been a clinical psychologist in private practice for 28 years, and is the former director of psychology in a private psychiatric hospital. For the past 18 years, he has also served as a consulting psychologist at the West Caldwell Care Center, where he provides diagnostic assessments and individual therapy for a geriatric population. He is the author of three books on substance abuse.<br \/><br \/>Seven keys to optimizing your life are:<br \/><br \/>1. Awareness and empowerment.  Recognize that you can change the world—the world that matters most for your resilience and verve.  Allow the appropriate authorities to deal with the important matters beyond your direct control.<br \/><br \/>2.  Visual appeal.  Make yourself and your surroundings pleasant.  You will look and feel better and you will be more attractive to others.<br \/><br \/>3. Association with positive people.  Make it a priority to spend as much time with people who are supportive, comforting, fun, and who make you feel good.<br \/><br \/>4. Mindful consumption.  You consume food and drink, as well as mental stimulation.  If you pollute your body with poor food choices, excesses of low quality foods, alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, you will suffer the consequences.  Similarly, you must choose healthy “mind food”: a diverse diet consisting of reading, writing, talking, meditating, listening to music, and watching television and movies.<br \/><br \/>5. Engagement in regular exercise.  The environment is not just good to look at.  You benefit by moving around in it.  A significant part of joy in life comes from physical activity.  Go for walks, ride a bike, or engage in any other activity that you enjoy and can safely participate in.<br \/><br \/>6. Setting of modest, achievable goals.  Do not overwhelm yourself by being too ambitious.  Take the low-hanging fruit and build on success.  If you feel you want to improve your fitness level, increase your physical exercise a little at a time.  Don’t set out to complete a marathon in a week, which is setting yourself up for failure.<br \/><br \/>7. Maintenance of a positive focus.  Whatever you direct your mind to will be what your body reacts to.  Discipline yourself to spend more time thinking about positives such as a gratitude list, happy memories, and successes.<br \/><br \/>If any of these make sense to you, then you are getting the right book.","images":[],"asin":"1633880168","parent_asin":"1633880168","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1431907510000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2735,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"Novelization of wealthy a American family living on the French Riviera during the roaring Twenties","text":"The author owns the time, the place, the people they came to vivid in this captivating read. I keep remembering snippets weeks after finishing the novel. Having read F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender Is the Night decades ago after watching the TV movie adaptation I was intrigued to read a new fictionalization of their lives this time with the author using their actual names, adhering to many known events while still throwing a couple whopper stories herself.<br \/><br \/>Gerald Murphy (1888-1964) and Sara Wiborg  (1983-1975) who hosted parties for the 'bright young things'  artists and writers of the :Lost Generation&#34;.<br \/><br \/>Gerald luckily came from wealth because he had no aptitude or desire to work in the commercial world of his family's business and was able to support his love of art.  His life was paved with open open doors (failing entrance to Yale 3 times he finally got in and became close friends with classmate Cole Porter class of '13). Before the end of the the first chapter he will have your heart.<br \/><br \/>Sara also came from enormous wealth (the family had a mansion on 600 acres in East Hampton). They met because their parents traveled in the same social circles, and married in 1915 when Sara was 32 years old.<br \/><br \/>So glad I ordered a copy even if I felt the introduction of the fictional character Owen Chambers muddied the story rather than crystallized it. Epic Story stretching from 1898 when Gerald was 10 years old to 1935 and 1937 (perhaps the two most tragic years in their life) with a wonderful last chapter evokes all that was wonderful.","images":[],"asin":"0316211362","parent_asin":"0316211362","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1451265990000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1591,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"#4 in the Sam Levitt\/Elena Morales cozy mystery series set in the south of France","text":"From the author of the bestseller A YEAR IN PROVENCE, and author of the novel A GOOD YEAR which was turned into the Russell Crowe movie of the same name. This is the first Pete Mayle novel I have read, I never got around to reading his breakout hit 2 decades ago. It was a fun frothy confection more lighthearted than the movie Cary Grant \/ Grace Kelly movie TO CATCH A THIEF and very enjoyable.<br \/><br \/>I looked up the 3 earlier titles to get up to speed with the characters, they helped me so I include them here (I also will be adding them to my to be read pile):<br \/>THE CORSICAN CAPER (2014) Here is Peter Mayle at his effervescent best—his master sleuth, Sam Levitt, eating, drinking, and romancing his way through the South of France even as he investigates a case of deadly intrigue among the Riviera’s jet set. Billionaire Francis Reboul is taking in the view at his coastal estate, awaiting the arrival of vacationing friends Sam Levitt and Elena Morales, when he spies a massive yacht whose passengers seem a little too interested in his property. The yacht belongs to rapacious Russian tycoon Oleg Vronsky, who, for his own purposes, will stop at nothing to obtain Reboul’s villa. When Reboul refuses to sell, Vronsky’s methods quickly turn unsavory. Now it’s up to Sam—he’s saved Reboul’s neck before—to negotiate with an underworld of mercenaries and hit men, not to mention the Corsican mafia, to prevent his friend from becoming a victim of Vronsky’s “Russian diplomacy.”  The dire situation doesn’t stop Sam and Elena from attending glamorous fêtes where the wines and starlets alike sparkle, and enjoying sumptuous meals—from multicourse revelations to understated delights like the first asparagus of the season, on which one must make a wish. But as Sam’s sleuthing draws him closer to the truth of Vronsky’s schemes, he realizes Reboul might not be the only one unable to enjoy the good life for long. Brimming with entertaining twists, sparkling scenery, and mouthwatering gustatory interludes as only Peter Mayle can write them, The Corsican Caper is a one-way ticket to pleasure, Provençal style.<br \/><br \/>THE MARSEILLE CAPER (2012) Lovable rogue and sleuth extraordinaire, Sam Levitt is back in another beguiling, as-only-Peter-Mayle-can-write-it romp through the South of France. At the end of The Vintage Caper, Sam had just carried off a staggering feat of derring-do in the heart of Bordeaux, infiltrating the ranks of the French elite to rescue a stolen, priceless wine collection. With the questionable legality of the adventure-and the threat of some very powerful enemies!-Sam thought it'd be a while before he returned to France, especially with the charms of the beautiful Elena Morales to keep him in Los Angeles. But when the immensely wealthy Francis Reboul-the victim of Sam's last heist but someone who knows talent when he sees it-asks our hero to take a job in Marseille, it's impossible for Sam and Elena to resist the possibility of further excitement... to say nothing of the pleasures of the region. Soon the two are enjoying the coastal sunshine and the delectable food and wine for which Marseille is known. Yet as a competition over Marseille's valuable waterfront grows more hotly disputed, Sam, representing Reboul, finds himself in the middle of an increasingly intrigue-ridden and dangerous real-estate grab, with thuggish gangsters on one side and sharklike developers on the other. Will Sam survive this caper unscathed? Will he live to enjoy another bowl of bouillabaisse? All will be revealed-with luck, savvy, and a lot of help from Sam's friends-in the novel's wonderfully satisfying climax.<br \/><br \/>THE VINTAGE CAPER (2009) Set in Hollywood, Paris, Bordeaux, and Marseille, Peter Mayle’s newest and most delightful novel is filled with culinary delights, sumptuous wines, and colorful characters. It’s also a lot of fun. The story begins high above Los Angeles, at the extravagant home and equally impressive wine cellar of entertainment lawyer Danny Roth. Unfortunately, after inviting the Los Angeles Times to write an extensive profile extolling the liquid treasures of his collection, Roth finds himself the victim of a world-class wine heist.Enter Sam Levitt, former corporate lawyer, cultivated crime expert, and wine connoisseur. Called in by Roth’s insurance company, which is now saddled with a multimillion-dollar claim, Sam follows his leads—to Bordeaux and its magnificent vineyards, and to Provence to meet an eccentric billionaire collector who might possibly have an interest in the stolen wines. Along the way, bien sûr, he is joined by a beautiful and erudite French colleague, and together they navigate many a château, pausing frequently to enjoy the countryside’s abundant pleasures. The unraveling of the ingenious crime is threaded through with Mayle’s seductive rendering of France’s sensory delights—from a fine Lynch-Bages and Léoville Barton to the bouillabaisse of Marseille and the young lamb of Bordeaux. Even the most sophisticated of oenophiles will learn a thing or two from this vintage work by a beloved author.","images":[],"asin":"0385353901","parent_asin":"0385353901","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1443668803000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":5114,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"Excellent advice for managers looking to make aggressive changes","text":"“Stacking The Deck” is written in a conversational tone unlike some managerial change books that are full of exercises and charts.  In part one of the book, the author describes the nine steps toward achieving favorable change.  These stages include developing a sense of urgency, unifying the team, communicating a clear vision, etc.  Part two of the book focuses in the broad sense on how to lead this change which is mostly about effective communication and good planning.<br \/><br \/>There are some gems of wisdom in this text.  For instance, as part of step 8 (which is assessing, recruiting, and empowering the broader team), the author makes it clear why you might hire someone who failed on a project. The reason is that those who failed and learned from their mistakes may offer priceless insight.<br \/><br \/>In the communicating and connecting to inspire chapter he makes it clear that “it is not about what you say; it’s about what they hear.”  You may think your message inspires and motivates, but if your team has not heard it that way, you have not succeeded.<br \/><br \/>Two more quotes that I found inspiring were:<br \/><br \/>1)  “We earn the right to communicate electronically by the time and energy we invest in communicating personally.”<br \/><br \/>2) “Electronic communication is a tool for communicating information—not for inspiring passion.”<br \/><br \/>In combination with the excellent advice, I would have liked examples with more substance, however.  For instance, he told how Howard Schultz (Starbucks CEO) inspired his staff everywhere by penning a weekly “Transformational Agenda” that he released on Monday’s.  I would have liked a sample “agenda” in the book that dissected “why and how” this worked.  In another example, the author himself mentioned that he was questioned by an employee in a town hall meeting about how he and other executives received multi-million dollar bonuses and wanted to know how this equates with the “culture of economy and expense control” he was espousing.  The author mentioned how he publicly congratulated the employee for asking such a difficult question but never said how he answered it or why his answer worked and was inspiring.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I feel this is a great book from which current and aspiring managers can gain some insight on how to lead change and inspire others. For me, I would have to read this more than once to make the concepts my own as it is chock full of good advice.","images":[],"asin":"1118966880","parent_asin":"1118966880","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1416972687000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2464,"length_group":3}

I ordered this title because I liked the cover, now I am going back to the library in hopes of ordering the NINE other titles in the series - I read the summaries of the previous titles in the series to help me figure out what was what - I included them below for anyone who mught be new to the series:<br \/><br \/>Cast in Shadow Book #1 (2006): Seven years ago Kaylin fled the crime-riddled streets of Nightshade, knowing that something was after her. Children were being murdered, and all had the same odd markings that mysteriously appeared on her own skin. Since then, she's learned to read, she's learned to fight and she's become one of the vaunted Hawks who patrol and police the City of Elantra. Alongside the winged Aerians and immortal Barrani, she's made a place for herself, far from the mean streets of her birth. But children are once again dying, and a dark and familiar pattern is emerging, Kaylin is ordered back into Nightshade with a partner she knows she can't trust, a Dragon lord for a companion and a device to contain her powers, powers that no other human has. Her task is simple, find the killer, stop the murders, and survive the attentions of those who claim to be her allies!<br \/><br \/>Cast in Courtlight Book 2 (2007): In Elantra, a job well done is rewarded with a more dangerous task. And so, after defeating a dark evil, Kaylin must enter a place of deceit and treachery. A world where silk and jewels hide deadly secrets. Kaylin goes before the Barrani High Court, where a misspoken word brings sure death. And Kaylin's never been known for her grace or manners. But the High Lord's heir is suspiciously ill and Kaylin's healing magic is the only shot at saving him, if she manages to dodge the traps laid for her. Only to discover that the healing might turn out to be the simplest of the tasks before her.<br \/><br \/>Cast in Secret, Book 3 (2008): Still avoiding magic whenever possible, Private Kaylin Neya relished investigating a run-of-the-mill theft. Until she found out the mysterious stolen box had been taken from Elani Street, where the mages and charlatans mingled, and it was sometimes hard to tell the difference between the two. And since the box was ancient, without a keyhole, and held tremendous darkness inside, Kaylin knew unknown forces were again playing with her destiny--and her life.<br \/><br \/>Cast in Fur, Book 4 (2008): When a minority race of telepaths is suspected of causing a near-devastating tidal wave, Private Kaylin Neya is summoned to Court and into a PR nightmare. To ease racial tensions, the emperor has commissioned a play, and the playwright has his own ideas about who should be the focus. But Kaylin works her best magic behind the scenes, and though she tries to stay neutral, she is again drawn into a world of politics and murder. To make matters worse, Marcus, her trusted sergeant, gets stripped of his command, leaving Kaylin vulnerable. Now she's juggling two troubling cases, and even magic's looking good by comparison. But then nobody ever said life in the theater was easy.<br \/><br \/>Cast in Silence, Book 5 (2009): A member of the elite Hawk force that protects the City of Elantra, Kaylin Neya has sacrificed much to earn the respect of the winged Aerians and immortal Barrani she works alongside. But the mean streets she escaped as a child aren't the ones she's vowed to give her life guarding. Those were much darker. Kaylin's moved on with her life and is keeping silent about the shameful things she's done to stay alive. But when the city's oracles warn of brewing unrest in the outer fiefdoms, a mysterious visitor from Kaylin's past casts her under a cloud of suspicion. Thankfully, if she's anything, she's a survivor.<br \/><br \/>Cast in Chaos, Book 6 (2010): Kaylin Neya is a Hawk, part of the elite force tasked with keeping the City of Elantra safe. Her past is dark, her magic uncontrolled and her allies unpredictable. And nothing has prepared her for what is coming, when the charlatans on Elani Street suddenly grow powerful, the Oracles are thrown into an uproar and the skies rain blood. The powerful of Elantra believe that the mysterious markings on Kaylin's skin hold the answer, and they are not averse to using her, how ever they have to, in order to discover what it is. Something is coming, breaking through the barriers between the worlds. But is it a threat that Kaylin needs to defend her city against or has she been chosen for another reason entirely?<br \/><br \/>Cast in Ruin, Book 7 (2011): Seven corpses are discovered in the streets of a Dragon's fief. All identical, down to their clothing. Kaylin Neya is assigned to discover who they were, who killed them, and why. Is the evil lurking at the borders of Elantra preparing to cross over? At least the investigation delays her meeting with the Dragon Emperor. And as the shadows grow longer over the fiefs, Kaylin must use every skill she's ever learned to save the people she's sworn to protect. Sword in hand, dragons in the sky, this time there's no retreat and no surrender.<br \/><br \/>Cast in Peril, Book 8 (2012): It has been a busy few weeks for Private Kaylin Neya. In between angling for a promotion, sharing her room with the last living female Dragon and dealing with more refugees than anyone knew what to do with, the unusual egg she'd been given began to hatch. Actually, that turned out to be lucky, because it absorbed the energy from the bomb that went off in her quarters. So now might be the perfect time to leave Elantra and journey to the West March with the Barrani. If not for the disappearances of citizens in the fief of Tiamaris, disappearances traced to the very Barrani Kaylin is about to be traveling with.<br \/><br \/>Cast in Sorrow, Book 9 (2013): The Barrani would be happy to see her die. So Kaylin Neya is a bit surprised by her safe arrival in the West March. Especially when enemies new and old surround her and those she would call friends are equally dangerous. And then the real trouble starts. Kaylin's assignment is to be a \"harmoniste\" (one who helps tell the truth behind a Barrani Recitation). But in a land where words are more effective than weapons, Kaylin's duties are deadly. With the wrong phrase she could tear a people further asunder. And with the right ones, well, then she might be able to heal a blight on a race. If only she understood the story.","images":[],"asin":"0778317080","parent_asin":"0778317080","user_id":"AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA","timestamp":1418062848000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":6504,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Entertaining international post-WWII detective story","text":"It is 1947. Billie Walker, private enquiry agent, working in Sydney Australia, has become rather notorious after a Nazi war criminal died in a fall from her office balcony at the end of her last major case.  Now, Vera Montgomery, a wealthy client wants to find her husband Robert who disappeared, possibly in France, in 1945.  Billie is ambivalent about the need to travel to Paris, which is filled with memories of her husband, last seen in Warsaw during a violent time near the end of the war.  She wonders if she will be able to get more information about what happened to him.  It has been three years since she last heard from him.  She assumes he is dead.<br \/><br \/>The Ghosts of Paris is a nicely crafted detective story, with most of the action taking place in postwar London and Paris.  Billie and her hunky assistant Sam travel together to seek out Montgomery and confirm his death or secure a divorce and financial settlement for his wife.  Along the way, they run into far more excitement then they bargained for.  Moss creates a sense of the time with the rubble of London, bombed tirelessly and Paris, left comparatively untouched, of the Nuremberg trials and executions of Nazi war crimes, of Odessa activities, good guys cloak and dagger action and a neat view of LGBTQ legal issues in Australia, where homosexual acts were still criminalized, and Paris, where they were not.<br \/><br \/>All in all this was a fun, wanted to keep getting back to it, story.

{"rating":4,"title":"Colorful, in-depth, good maps...in short, there's something here for everyone","text":"I checked out Fodor's Paris 2010 because I may be going to France later this year. It's been eight years since my last visit to Paris, and I was looking for up-to-date information on Paris's arrondissements, markets, and cultural activities. Fodor's guide begins on an upbeat note by dismissing the \"rude Parisian\" myth, and the ways in which Paris has cleaned up its image in the last couple of decades: smoking laws (smoking is now banned in offices and public buildings, including hotels and restaurants), the addition of bus, bike and pedestrian lanes, an improvement in customer service, and the rise of immigration and globalization (although 34 Starbucks in Paris may NOT be such a good thing, since French caf&eacute; culture is unique).<br \/><br \/>Fodor's Paris 2010 is ideal for exploring on your own: the excellent maps include metro stops (there's even a full-size removable map in the back), and many of the finds are submitted by users on the Fodor's forum. It pays to read these tips, since these travelers found themselves where you soon might be. There's a small section devoted to Paris with kids, with listings of kid-friendly museums, sites and shows, and great ways to wear out the kids (hiking to the top of the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame). For those on a budget, there are many suggestions of free (and almost-free) activities. Included in the listings are phone numbers, hours, and websites. It's always a good idea to check the website before you go, since hours are subject to change.<br \/><br \/>Of course, haute couture and shopping in Paris is a prominent draw, and you'll find Herm&egrave;s, Chanel, Dior and Yves Saint Laurent featured alongside museum stores, flea markets, vintage clothing and home d&eacute;cor. As a Dolce & Gabbana addict, I had to laugh at the brand's description as \"a sexy, young-Italian-widow vibe with a side of moody boyfriend.\" One of my favorite designers, Ren&eacute; Derhy, who dabbles in exotic, vintage-style dresses, skirts and tops, isn't mentioned, but he does have a boutique in the Galeries Lafayette Hausmann location.<br \/><br \/>The photos and illustrations are first-rate, particularly the Notre Dame spread on pages 46-47. The section on the Louvre includes an illustrated timeline along with must-see items by room. There are also side trips from Paris, including Disneyland Paris and Versailles. Rounding out the book is a section on recommended books and movies about Paris (yes, [[ASIN:B0000640VO Amelie]] and [[ASIN:B00005JOC9 The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] are both there) and a small French-English glossary. The descriptions and notes are liberally sprinkled with humor (the section on Versailles is called \"Gilt Trip\").<br \/><br \/>I loved the quirky \"fashion\" spreads that showcased a sampling of Parisian trends, such as \"La Jeune Femme\" (inspiration: Audrey Tautou), with her denim mini, ballet flats, Converse high tops and a Vanessa Bruno tote, or the sophisticated \"La Grande Dame\" (think Catherine Deneuve), with her Kelly bag and Chanel No. 5. There are even tips on how to tie scarves and do's and don'ts of dressing in Paris (DO: wear black. DON'T: get a French manicure (!), dress like you're going to camp, or match your shoes to your bag).<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a great guide that caters to a wide range of travelers, from budget (there are some hotels listed that are 80 Euros a night or less, but at the expense of no AC, no phone, no TV, no elevator, etc.) to the Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, which will set you back a whopping 750 Euros a night and up. Similarly, dining options range from casual brasseries and neighborhood bistros to falafel, vegetarian offerings, \"hidden\" restaurants and haute cuisine. There's something here for everyone, and the colorful photos and detailed maps will help you navigate with ease.","images":[],"asin":"1400008387","parent_asin":"1400008387","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1276461571000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3856,"length_group":3}

{"rating":4,"title":"Close to Home","text":"In December 2006, my home state of Oregon was getting all sorts of national media coverage, and none of it was good. In early December, the Kim family - wife, husband, and two daughters from California - got lost traveling a logging road in the Southern Oregon snow. The father died from exposure while trying to find help; the mother and daughters were found alive. Then just two weeks later, three climbers went missing on Mount Hood. Our hearts already broken for the Kim family's loss, many Oregonians stayed glued to the news as the search for the hikers was complicated by horrible weather on the mountain. We were all hoping for the very best for these hikers and their families, but it would turn out to be another sad tragedy in our great state.<br \/><br \/>When I saw that Karen James, wife of one of the climbers lost on Mount Hood, had written a book about her family's experiences, I was eager to read this story from her perspective. To me, she was a name and a face on my daily news during that dark month of December 2006. But in Holding Fast: The Untold Story of the Mount Hood Tragedy, I got to meet her and her amazing family, hear the love story behind her marriage to Kelly James, and discover the lasting faith that carried her through her loss.<br \/><br \/>Holding Fast is a moving account of Karen's unwanted journey. It's written in a very conversational tone, creating an intimate atmosphere full of feeling. She gives precious insight into the passion that drove Kelly James to climb many of the world's greatest mountains. She shows how her faith, and the faith of Kelly's children, guided them through their unimaginable trials. She also pieces together details of Kelly's final hours, providing a likely scenario for what happened on the mountain and how Kelly honored his family in the last moments of his life.<br \/><br \/>I enjoyed this book and read it in just a few hours. I felt glad to be taken into Karen James' confidence and encouraged by the strength of her faith and the admonition she gives that we ought to appreciate every moment we have while our loved ones are here with us on earth.<br \/><br \/>Thank you to Thomas Nelson for this review copy.","images":[],"asin":"1595551751","parent_asin":"1595551751","user_id":"AGGHHNTNWUXUG2LEOP4KGUMULISQ","timestamp":1227795888000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2187,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Some great information crammed into a very small book","text":"[[VIDEOID:7df4af9f322ab66be9930e7e573597d9]] So here is what I'm looking for in a photography field guide - information that helps me when I need it in the field.  I have long owned and treasured [[ASIN:0817435425 Art of Bird Photography: The Complete Guide to Professional Field Techniques (Practial Photography Books)]] and there are a few crucial pages I ended up photocopying and putting in my photograph bag.  They have simple graphics for considerations you need to make when photographing white birds against a dark background or vice versa.  That is the kind of information I was hoping was in this book.  And to a degree it was here.<br \/><br \/>Due to the small format of the book and the very small sized text, this book should have focused on what is needed in the field. The middle of Bosque Del Apache is not the time to debate .jpeg vs RAW but it is the time to get some quick hints about capturing flight photos.  Digital Photography 101 should be left to a bigger book you can enjoy at home with full sized text.<br \/><br \/>I wish that rather than discussing what to look for in a DSLR, it had an annotated checklist of what to pack for your trip.  I'm not knocking the authors for their content, it is all solid, but due to the format I wish they stuck to the immediate field needs. To stereotype, Birdwatchers have aging eyes and it is a slog to read the text cover to cover due to the tiny font size.  It would have been nice to find pages on those in the field needs, like those charts in Morris' book, how should I handle a backlit flight shot of a overflying eagle.  How should I use fill flash to light a roosting owl.  How do I use the histogram (which is covered well in this book.)  Also it would be nice to have a cold weather section focusing on camera care and exposure hints to shoot in a snowy winter landscape.  Well I guess there is my million dollar idea for what it's worth, a field guide focused on what you actually need when you are in the field.<br \/><br \/>What I do like is the coverage of post photography.  It is complete but not exhaustive.  I like that the book is full of beautiful and inspiring photographs, although the book has a European bias in photos and content.  And I like the content in general, just doesn't all fit the format.<br \/><br \/>See accompanying video for details on size.<br \/><br \/>Summary<br \/><br \/>A very good book that may not be exactly what I was hoping for, but well worthwhile.  Text is small enough to be a chore to read.  Beautifully illustrated.

{"rating":4,"title":"Attractive Knitted Gifts (Matching Hats, Mittens, Socks, Ankle Warmers) for Adult Women","text":"Knitting books that have \"Easy\", \"Simple\", or \"Quick\" in the title are often disappointing, but this book is a delightful exception. It has clear instructions for 15 hats (including caps, bonnets, and berets), 11 mittens (some can be knitted as gloves), 7 socks (including a spiral sock), wrist warmers, and ankle warmers.  The patterns are all written for only one size (adult woman: average hat size 22\", hand width 3.75\", leg width 4.25\").<br \/><br \/>Most of the hat designs are accompanied by designs for either matching mittens or socks, and a few (Baggy, Stars, Spruce, and Flaps) have designs for both matching mittens and socks.  The patterns for heel-less spiral socks, a hat with earflaps, and ankle warmers are nice bonuses.<br \/><br \/>I was particularly intrigued by the ankle warmers (\"What do you do when your feet are cold and your shoes are too tight for wool socks?\"), which I hadn't seen before.  An ankle warmer is a heel-less, foot-less sock cuff, with an attached strap that goes around the arch of the foot to hold the \"sock top\" in place.  Ankle warmers appear to be fairly simple to knit, and the author rates them as an \"easy\" project.  The ankle warmer pattern would be easy to adjust to fit any size of person.<br \/><br \/>The book has an interior spiral binding, which is popular with many knitters because the pages lie flat.  Check the \"Look Inside\" feature on the product description page for complete instructions for knitting the Baggy, Scraps, Spruce, and Cables hats, and for a photo of the earflap hat (on the Table of Contents page).  This book is a great gift-knitting book, as long as you only need patterns for adult women.  It would rate 5 rather than 4 stars if the author had included instructions for resizing the patterns to fit a wider range of persons.","images":[],"asin":"1570764697","parent_asin":"1570764697","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1289776659000,"helpful_vote":14,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1798,"length_group":3}
{"rating":4,"title":"Two Murders in 1952 Prague, Where (Almost) Everyone Is a Spy","text":"Author Heda Margolius Kovaly, a survivor of both Auschwitz and her husband's 1952 execution via Stalinist &#34;show trial&#34;, was indeed born &#34;under a cruel star&#34;.  Her lovely little mystery novel, INNOCENCE; OR, MURDER ON STEEP STREET, is probably best understood as a semi-autobiographical nonfiction novel, a companion to her memoirs published as [[ASIN:0841913773 Under a Cruel Star: A Life in Prague 1941-1968]].<br \/><br \/>In INNOCENCE, a young wife, Helena Novakova, is working as an usher at a Prague movie house (the Horizon) in 1952.  She's a social outcast, because her husband (Karel) has been imprisoned on suspicion of spying against the state; and she, too, is suspected of spying.  Both spouses are innocent, but it doesn't matter.  In 1952 Prague, nearly everyone is a spy:  politicians, policemen, co-workers, neighbors, close relatives; and anyone can be imprisoned on the slightest pretext.<br \/><br \/>Two murders connected with the Horizon cinema occur within a few months.  The first murder, of a small boy, is solved quickly.  The second murder, of a man found knifed to death in a car parked outside the cinema, is much more difficult to solve.  The solution lies in the interwoven lives of Helena, Karel, the cinema's ushers and owner, the crime's investigators, the Prague politicians, and the ushers' boyfriends.  (The novel includes a third murder, a political one, but that solution is obvious to the reader from the moment the murder occurs.)<br \/><br \/>The novel's ending is satisfactory, but a little confusing to a reader like myself who isn't familiar with a society in which near-universal spying is the norm.  The novel is translated from the Czech, and it's a good translation, but the translation would be improved by giving the characters more distinctive, more Westernized names.  I found myself constantly flipping back to clarify which characters were which, as the characters' first and last names are used interchangeably, and the Czech names are difficult:  Vendys, Novakoma, Vaclav, Nedomova, Vojta, Vranova, Ladinka, Bozema, Sulcova, Novak, Koulousek, Kourimska, etc.<br \/><br \/>Because INNOCENCE is more of an autobiography than a mystery novel, and because I had so much difficulty keeping the characters' Czech names straight, I rate the book at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).  However, I enjoyed reading the book, and it's so well-written that I'm planning on reading Kovaly's' nonfiction memoirs.","images":[],"asin":"1616954965","parent_asin":"1616954965","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1430700401000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2487,"length_group":3}

The only reason I rated the book four stars is because you feel you are reading individual book reports instead of an engaging flowing narrative.  However, I am not sure this book could have been written any other way.<br \/><br \/>A website was mentioned as an extension to this book but no website address was given.  As of today I could not find such a site during a Google search.<br \/><br \/>\"Hope for Animals and their World...\" is definitely an enducational read for someone interested in the natural world.","images":[],"asin":"0446581771","parent_asin":"0446581771","user_id":"AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q","timestamp":1252067320000,"helpful_vote":24,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1513,"length_group":3}

{"rating":5,"title":"Johnny Tremain's female counterpart shines","text":"Abigail Jones, Nabby for short, is a headstrong young woman whose sole desire is to be apprenticed to a pewterer in colonial revolutionary Boston, an \"unfit\" occupation for a young lady. Recently orphaned, Nabby is saved from becoming a seamstress's apprentice when she is hired to care for a pewterer's crippled daughter. A female answer to literature's beloved Johnny Tremain, Nabby offers a colorful commentary on colonial Boston: its crusty sailors, British soldiers, new streetlamps, and pewter shops. Although not as politically involved as Johnny Tremain, Nabby and her charge Emily play a fateful role in several important events. Pencil illustrations serve to bring Nabby's story to life. Well written, humorous, and educational, this is the female answer to the male derring-do of Johnny Tremain and all too often male protagonists of young adult colonial historical fiction.

It jumps in increments of 7 years, starting with the time before his birth and leading up to his arrival, all the way to a few months before his death as an old man. I found it compelling and engaging throughout the whole book. It brought out several different emotions as I read it. There were times when I pitied Cyril. There were things that angered me.

{"rating":5,"title":"I love this series!","text":"I am a fan of historic novels--many of them either medieval or renaissance mysteries, some other forms of historic novel.  This is one of the best series I've read yet, well-researched and so much more than just a 'murder mystery'.  They give a good appreciation of specific times and events during the later years of King Henry VIII's reign, provoking a desire to learn more about the times (even though I've read a lot about the Tudors in factual detail) -- such as a biography of Thomas Cromwell, whom I'd never thought to be interested in before, as well as the dissolution of the monasteries.  Henry, himself, is not painted in a sympathetic light in any of the novels, which I believe, for this period, is quite accurate.  As a young king, Henry was much more admirable, but became increasingly self-serving, avaricious and disinterested in his people beyond how they could contribute to his aspirations to conquer and his greed for luxury.","images":[],"asin":"0143113178","parent_asin":"0143113178","user_id":"AEITH2MBDGMCSAZSBNAYOEBOJXFA","timestamp":1352754253000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"length":946,"length_group":2}

{"rating":5,"title":"Charming, Attractive, and Moving ABC Book","text":"This is a charming little ABC book for preschoolers.  It is subtitled &#34;A Natural Alphabet,&#34; and I found that it was true to that in many ways.  First, the animals and other items named in the book are somewhat unexpected.  For example, E is for egret, and Y is for yellow-bellied sapsucker.  I can imagine kids having fun with the language of the book.  Second, the illustrations are lovely.  They have the look and feel of woodcuts, though actually they are paper art.  Finally, the colors are subtle and beautiful.  There are grays, yellows, blues, browns, pinks--but nothing bright or garish.  (If you want bright colors and cute animals doing human things like washing dishes or cooking, this is not the book for you.)  This book would be a lovely and inexpensive shower gift.  Highly recommended.","images":[],"asin":"1632170396","parent_asin":"1632170396","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1445707077000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":809,"length_group":2}

{"rating":5,"title":"Good Format!","text":"I am a big fan of DK books, but this is my first Smithsonian one. I love the format of DK books. They have lots of photos and short sections. They're good for those with short attention spans. I am not good at reading non-fiction books, but the DK ones are broken up into small chunks which make it easier to read. My first reaction when I opened this one was that it brought back memories of a Time Life coffee table book of the 1960's that my parents had when I was a child. I was born in the late 60's, so a lot of my knowledge on this war is owed to movies and may not be entirely accurate. This book covers a lot of information, starting in the 1950's and going into the 1970's. I personally don't believe that this one book can cover everything that happened, but it's a great start. It's a thorough overview of the war and the events leading up to it. The photographs bring the subject to life. The book is informative and engaging.","images":[],"asin":"1465457690","parent_asin":"1465457690","user_id":"AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A","timestamp":1494550998000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":939,"length_group":2}

Both of my kids (now teenagers) would spend hours looking through their DK books. They had books on various animals, plants, historical events and time periods, Star Wars, and Lego ones. Within the last year, I became acquainted with the Smithsonian Series. They have the features that I loved about DK books and more. The more being that they are much thicker than the original DK books my kids grew up on.  They're both informative and interesting. The Explanatorium of Nature is filled with beautiful photographs and facts. It seems like it's the next step beyond the original series, geared toward older kids or even adults.

{"rating":5,"title":"Flavors, freshness and love","text":"\"This is indeed India...the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend, and the great grandmother of tradition...Our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India only.\" Mark Twain<br \/><br \/>\"Spices and Seasons: Simple, Sustainable Indian Flavors\" by Rinku Bhattacharya ([[ASIN:0781813050 The Bengali Five Spice Chronicles]]) introduces readers to the cooking of today's India - a cuisine that is innovative, inspired, and full of possibilities. Many of us are only familiar with the heavy, cream-laced dishes in Indian restaurants, but Rinku's goal is to show that Indian cooking is more about flavors, freshness and love. Her emphasis on fresh, local ingredients (preferably from your own backyard, farmer's market, or CSA) and sustainability pair beautifully with Indian spices and simple, nourishing preparations that will delight family and friends.<br \/><br \/>Beautifully photographed and printed in the USA, the book begins with several short primers to sustainability in the Indian kitchen and learning the essentials (spices, oils, tools). Unlike some Indian cookbooks, \"Spices and Seasons\" does not require a long list of exotic imported cookware, and many of the ingredients should be readily available at larger grocery stores. Each recipe has a vibrant, full-color photo illustrating it.<br \/><br \/>Beginning with appetizers, you will find many great ideas that come together quickly. Some standouts include the mango and goat cheese mini crisps, shortcut vegetable samosas, chicken tikka and almond and saffron salmon kabobs. The remainder of the recipes are grouped by season; not surprisingly, there is a whole chapter of lentil and bean-based recipes, several of which are prepared in the slow cooker. I loved the comforting slow-cooked chickpeas with tomatoes and ginger (I used chipotles in adobo since that was what I had on hand) and the egg curries as I am always looking for new ideas to incorporate hard-boiled eggs.<br \/><br \/>Each recipe is prefaced with a brief introduction to its region, family history, and handy tips that will ensure a great result every time. Simple, flavorful preparations make the most of seasonal ingredients. I loved the tandoori spice roasted baby potatoes with mint, broccoli with toasted cashew nuts, the autumn dishes for shrimp in a mango basil sauce and salmon with a blood orange and tamarind glaze, and rich coconut curries. Other meats are featured, but the seafood section really shines. One of my favorite discoveries was the Japanese-inspired wasabi ginger fish with fresh blackberries; the sweetness of the maple syrup and blackberries offsets the umami of the soy sauce and the pungency of the ginger.<br \/><br \/>Chapter nine features pilafs and grains, which oftentimes are a main meal for me. There is also a chapter featuring traditional breads and crepes like naan, puri, dosas, and oothapams that take the mystery out of homemade breads to accompany your Indian feasts. Desserts are on the lighter side, and many feature fruit or fruit ices.<br \/><br \/>Several basic wet and dry spice blends are also included (chaat masala, tandoori masala, garam masala, curry powder) that give a much different, more vibrant flavor to your finished dish than using bland premixed blends from a grocery store and it is well worth investing the extra time to make up these mixes in advance.<br \/><br \/>In addition to being very suitable for vegetarians and pescetarians (there are many meat-free options and appealing seafood recipes), there is a gluten-free and vegan\/vegetarian index and all recipes are also marked as vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free.<br \/><br \/>This is one of those rare cookbooks that I am compelled to cook my way through cover to cover; I have not had the pleasure of reading \/ cooking from Rinku's first book \"The Bengali Five Spice Chronicles,\" but based on my experience with \"Spices and Seasons,\" it will be next on my list!<br \/><br \/>Verdict: \"Spices and Seasons\" is an absolute must-own for anyone who enjoys Indian food or is simply looking for simple, healthful ways to make the most of an abundance of garden vegetables or a CSA box.<br \/><br \/>Thank you to Rinku for the review copy!","images":[],"asin":"078181331X","parent_asin":"078181331X","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1415461359000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4287,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A very timely book","text":"What makes \"Gangster Capitalism\" so worthwhile is that it helps in understanding what has led us to the 2007-8 financial meltdown. As the book shows, like during the 1920's, deregulation led the way for powerful companies to allow the very wealthy to get wealthier at the expense of average people by using poor working conditions, low wages, etc, plus at the same time supporting supposedly moral movements (against gambling, alcohol, drugs, etc) which mainly served the purpose of making these trades more profitable to crooks and therefore created rampant gangsterism there. The result was such a society wracked with gangsterism at all levels, but because most people felt they were prospering, few complained. But, then it all collapsed with the 1929 crash and resulting Depression, which led the way for FDR and the New Deal programs which increased regulation of corporations, repeal of Prohibition, etc. Though the Depression lingered until WWII, the New Deal was successful in restructuring our laws and public infrastructure to create a better footing for the prosperity which would follow. The book effectively traces how much of this regulation was reduced piece by piece, beginning in earnest with Nixon, using Cold War fears to tilt the nation toward more corporate power and away from reform, support of right-wing dictators around the world, re-energizing a 'moral crusade' especially by beginning the War on Drugs, thereby making the illegal drug trade super profitable, etc. The nation had shifted Right and even Democratic presidents like Carter who was instrumental in deregulating industry and Clinton who signed into law the repeal of Glass--Steagle weren't able to stop the shift. Then, the 'Gangster Capitalism\" went on steroids with G. W. Bush. By 2003, corporate taxes only amounted to 7% of revenues, while payroll taxes amounted to 40%.<br \/><br \/>Of note, the book makes clear it is opportunity which leads to much crime, so the approach of massive deregulation of corporations, plus focusing on arrests and imprisonment for victimless crimes ends up with the wrong results, more entrenched crime, even allowing corporations to capitalize on a prison industry. The book is also good at highlighting how corporations and outright gangsters were able to corrupt legal drugs (price-fixing), tobacco, asbestos, body parts, autos (Pintos), etc. Some other things in the book, of note: Hamid Karzai included drug traffickers in his Afghan administration. And, our support of Suharto (Indonesia), Mobuto (the Congo), and Marcos (the Philippines) allowed 'looting' of these countries. A corrupt financial infrastructure included the BCCI bank and offshore banking to evade taxes also developed. Plus, laundering money from illegal arms sales, drugs, and so many other illegal activities passed through our financial system.<br \/><br \/>The book is definitely tilted toward a liberal way of looking at things, therefore it doesn't go into the good things about capitalism, but there are disturbing patterns which are important to understand, and this book does that very well.","images":[],"asin":"0786716711","parent_asin":"0786716711","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1226860310000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":true,"length":3095,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"The foremost authority on Santiago de Compostela tells all","text":"I have just had the pleasure of attending a seminar by Linda Kay Davidson entitled &quot;On the Road to Compostela,&quot; in which she narrated a two-hour slideshow of her five pilgrimages in Spain with her husband and several students. Much of the content of &quot;The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago&quot; was touched upon during the lecture: the religious background, various myths and legends, stories from the rural villages along the road, and the spiritual experience involved.<br \/>One of my favourite moments was when Davidson asked, &quot;What is a pilgrimage?&quot; The audience was composed of various nationalities, religions and ethnic groups, but we all had ideas to offer. The third or fourth brave soul said that a pilgrimage was a religious experience. She continued her explanation and we arrived at the definition of a pilgrimage as a journey that takes one away from comforts and friends, a journey of self-discovery, and one that must be made on foot.<br \/>She mentioned other secular pilgrimages: Graceland, the Alamo, and on a more sombre note, the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City and the former site of the World Trade Centre in New York City. A pilgrimage can extend to finding a deeper meaning in life, not necessarily of a religious nature, a pilgrimage as a voyage of discovery.<br \/>I was fortunate to attend Linda Kay Davidson's seminar; I learned a great deal about pilgrimages in general and Santiago de Compostela, about the history of the region, the terrain, the rural towns and friendly townsfolk, cloistered nuns who had not seen the next village over and would never do so except by postcard, the architecture, from gothic to baroque, the sometimes humorous stories of saints' lives, the sombre roadside shrines for pilgrims who ultimately did not finish their journey.<br \/>This is an excellent guide to Santiago de Compostela whether you are merely interested in reading more about the region or if you are planning a pilgrimage yourself. And if you have the chance to see Linda Kay Davidson in person, do so. She makes the journey a memorable one, taking time at the end of the seminar to show a brief slideshow with a medieval soundtrack and had us mentally create (or recreate) a pilgrimage of our own to Compostela. It was a fascinating experience and one I won't soon forget.","images":[],"asin":"0312254164","parent_asin":"0312254164","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1002679476000,"helpful_vote":18,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2328,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A wonderful resource for home bakers","text":"Hot Bread Kitchen, based in NYC, builds lasting economic security for low-income, immigrant and minority individuals by creating pathways to professional opportunities in the culinary industry. 67% of their operating budget is funded through the sale of multi-ethnic breads and rental of commercial kitchen space. The range of breads that they bake and deliver includes Iran (nan-e-barbari, a chewy flatbread topped with black and white sesame seeds, and nan-e-qandi), Morocco (m'smen, a flaky flatbread traditionally served for breakfast with honey), Mexico (corn tortillas), Eastern Europe (challah), Ethiopia (the slightly sour injera, fermented teff flour served with wat), and more.​<br \/><br \/> The long-awaited Hot Bread Kitchen Cookbook is divided by bread type: unleavened and flatbreads, lean breads and rolls, enriched breads, rolls, and buns, filled doughs, and quick breads and holiday breads. You'll find favorites from India (paratha, naan, chapatis), the Middle East (hummus, pita), Eastern Europe (challah, matzo, eier kichel, bialys, knishes, kreplach, nut roll), France \/ Italy (batard, pan bagnat, olive boules, ciabatta) and Mexico \/ Latin America (pan de muertos, conchas, tortillas, guacamole, tamales, tostadas, empanadas). Other little-known gems include Albanian cheese triangles, Tibetan momos, Another thing I liked was that various recipes are included that use leftover bread, from bread puddings and stale bread (panzanella, tres leches bread pudding with Mexican chocolate sauce, ribollita), to complementary dishes (curry, wat, stews, dips, salads) that pair perfectly with the included bread recipes.<br \/><br \/>I consider myself a fairly competent home baker; I have long worked with yeast breads (including fresh cake yeast) both kneading by hand and stand mixer, and I welcomed the challenge of new bread types. Step-by-step photos (for trickier items like braiding challah) are particularly helpful for novice bakers. As a longtime baker of challah, I particularly appreciated the many challah recipes, including basic, raisin, whole wheat and Sephardic. You'll even find Vietnamese-style bagueettes and iced Vietnamese coffee.<br \/><br \/> This lovely selection of breads and accompanying dishes, sauces, and sides is rounded out by baker profiles and a very thorough guide to tips, equipment, and bread storage suggestions. Ingredients are given in US volume and metric (for my baking books, I generally prefer weight measurements, so appreciated having the metric weights given). Gorgeous photos give serving suggestions for each bread and side dish featured in the book. A list of online\/mail-order sources and a hefty list of acknowledgments round out the book.<br \/><br \/>An excellent resource for home bakers, especially if you already have some prior bread baking experience.

Bruce-san takes us along on his eye-opening hospital stay, on learning how to pick up Japanese girls at bars, on seasonal trips for fall viewings, skiing, and more.<br \/><br \/>One obvious advantage in Bruce's camp was the fact that he already spoke Japanese and had previously lived in Japan, easing his transition. Although the portrait of Japanese society is somewhat dated (late '80s, much has transpired since then with the Japanese economy), his portrayal of a country at odds with its unique culture versus globalization, of the schools serving as parents and educators combined, and of the group, rather than the individual, as a unit captures the Japanese spirit.

{"rating":5,"title":"Simple and delicious family recipes","text":"I'm probably one of the very few who purchased this cookbook without having ever actually SEEN the Great British Bake-Off or Nadiya on the small screen...chalk that up to several overseas moves and the last couple of years without a TV or cable. However, I was intrigued by the snippets of information out about her debut cookbook, and decided to preorder from the UK. Despite the lack of TV, I regularly follow the careers of former GBBO contestants and own cookbooks by several, including the excellent &#34;Crumb&#34; by Ruby Tanoh (one of my blog's top cookbooks of 2014) and Edd Kimber (&#34;The Boy Who Bakes&#34;).<br \/><br \/>I love a good curry (Meera Sodha's books are some of my favorites), but due to a hectic work\/life balance, I really fall for doable, delicious recipes with easy results, and &#34;Nadiya's Kitchen&#34; delivers on both counts. Nadiya grew up in a British Bangladeshi family in Luton, where she taught herself to cook from cookbooks and YouTube videos. In 2015, she was chosen to appear on Great British Bake-Off and won. An audience favorite, Nadiya now has a spinoff BBC documentary &#34;The Chronicles of Nadiya&#34; as well as several book deals (&#34;Nadiya's Kitchen,&#34; the children's book \/ cookbook &#34;Bake Me A Story,&#34; as well as her first novel).<br \/><br \/>In her first cookbook, Nadiya collects familiar (British) favorites like the Full English (here presented as a frittata), meat pies, and cherry Bakewell with a hefty dose of the international (chilli cheese burritos, gnocchi with cheese, pine nuts and rocket, grilled halloumi with pomegranate salsa, kofta kebab, Asian-inspired seafood) as well as Indian and Bengali fare (meat samosas, korma, curry, kedgeree). True to her word, many recipes do come together quickly and are fairly simple. Thanks to the detailed step-by-step photographs for more involved recipes, even novice cooks can turn out a delicious dinner.<br \/><br \/>The chapters are arranged by theme rather than meal (teatime, dessert for dinner, dinner date, cosy evenings and midnight feasts, etc.), so it may take a bit of flipping to locate the recipe or type of dish you're looking for.<br \/><br \/>For this review, I made several recipes from &#34;Nadiya's Kitchen&#34; including the showstopping oven-roasted sweet tomato and Parmesan tart, mustard and kale mac and cheese, quick boiled egg curry, and sour cherry and almond Bundt cake. The tomato Parmesan tart has you essentially candy cherry tomatoes with a touch of sugar, balsamic and olive oil. If pressed for time, an all-butter refrigerated pie crust can be substituted for the homemade one. You first blind bake the crust before layering with half the tomatoes and adding a rich cheese-enhanced custard (I also added some sprigs of fresh thyme to add a little extra flavor).  This was absolutely lovely served with a simple green salad (and I actually prefer eating it cold rather than warm).<br \/><br \/>Next up was the quick boiled egg curry. I usually have a surplus of hard-boiled eggs in the refrigerator (I steam them in batches in my rice cooker), and am always looking for new ways to use them, so I loved the idea of adding them to a curry. You start by cooking down tomatoes, onion, and spices into a dry paste, then frying up the eggs separately. Two observations here: first, the amount of paste hardly seems generous enough for six eggs \/ several servings if you like your curry a bit heartier \/ saucier (I ended up with maybe 1.5 cups of sauce after cooking down, which would yield 1\/4 cup per person if serving six as Nadiya recommends). Second, I had less success with frying up the eggs. You're supposed to score them then crisp in oil, but mine browned unevenly and didn't result in the crisp &#34;shell&#34; shown. I ended up using peeled hardboiled eggs and mixing them into the curry, and loved the final result.<br \/><br \/>The mustard and kale mac and cheese was a great update on a beloved classic; I added some panko breadcrumbs to the top as I love crunchy mac and cheese! If you can't find Coleman's mustard powder in your neck of the woods, French mustard or Japanese mustard powder is a respectable substitute. Kale being a tougher green, it froze and reheated beautifully and didn't turn slimy or mushy on reheating.<br \/><br \/>And as Nadiya is primarily known as a baker, how do the selection of baked goods hold up? The first recipe I tried was the sour cherry and almond Bundt, and it was every bit as gorgeous as the photo. My coworkers loved the balance of cherries and subtle hint of almond (the recipe uses both almond flour, although not entirely gluten-free, as well as almond extract). The crumb was moist and the cake held up well through several days of snacking.<br \/><br \/>There are also recipes for mocha macarons, homemade candy (peanut, black sesame and ginger brittle, chocolate-dipped honeycomb, candied orange peel, guava Turkish delight, salted pretzel fudge, speculoos hazelnut truffles), cookies galore (candied lemon, coconut and strawberry Anzacs, chocolate and date, matcha and milk chocolate), chocolate and hazelnut profiteroles, chocolate and star anise fondants, pavlovas and cream pies, nutmeg and orange baked cheesecake, raspberry jam puddle brownies, and a recipe for Her Majesty's Cake.<br \/><br \/>From comfort food (hello, mushroom, cheese and mustard croissants!) to more elegant fare (fresh sea bass fennel ceviche, crusted rack of lamb with aubergine bortha, crispy filo with seared tuna), &#34;Nadiya's Kitchen&#34; offers something for everyone, from beginning cooks to the more experienced.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71WTAe2EfpL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71WTAe2EfpL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71WTAe2EfpL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81bwrGNBXxL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81bwrGNBXxL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81bwrGNBXxL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81iGECsEM6L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81iGECsEM6L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81iGECsEM6L.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81sB+wjzQCL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81sB+wjzQCL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81sB+wjzQCL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"0718184513","parent_asin":"0718184513","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1474156804000,"helpful_vote":85,"verified_purchase":true,"length":5597,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A tale of Milagros (miracles)","text":"Julie Alvarez's (\"How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accent\") newest novel \"Finding Miracles\" is the story of Milly Milagros Kaufman, a typical all-American, half-Jewish high schooler with a not-so-typical secret: Milly was adopted as an infant from a war-torn Latin American country, where her adopted parents were serving in the Peace Corps.  Milly has managed to successfully keep this info from her best friend Em, friends Jake and Dylan, and the community at large, because thinking about her sickly beginnings at an orphanage dredged up too many painful questions about why she was abandoned at the doorstep, who her birth parents may have been and if they \"disappeared\" during the dictatorship.<br \/><br \/>Milly is forced to confront her past when Pablo Bol&iacute;var joins her grade at high school. Pablo and his parents are refugees from Milly's home country (which is never named).  One of his uncles was murdered, one of his brothers is a prisoner, and the other a revolutionary. Pablo asks Milly to help him with English in exchange for practicing Spanish, and one day makes a comment that changes Milly's life: he tells her that her eyes look like those of the mountain village Los Luceros.  Also, Milly overhears an angry family discussion in which her unhappy grandmother Happy effectively writes her out of her will as she is not a \"blood\" relation.<br \/><br \/>Milly begins to slowly examine her feelings by confronting \"The Box,\" a mahogany box containing her adoption papers, naturalization papers, two locks of hair (one light, one dark), a coin, and several photos, and in a brave speech running for a class office, tells the story of her adoption to the school at large. The second half of the novel chronicles Milly's journey to her homeland. When Milly's home country is freed from tyranny and democracy is slowly put into place, she takes up Mrs. Bol&iacute;var's invitation to visit, searching for traces of her shadowy past. Milly and Paco become more than just friends, bonded by the shared sadness of having lost loved ones in the war.<br \/><br \/>The novel does not have a \"fairy tale\" ending where everything works out perfectly, but the ending provided a satisfying conclusion to Milly's journey.  Realistically written and beautifully described, Alvarez captures a girl torn between cultures, languages, and her past, and how Milly, now Milagros, makes all the pieces fit.","images":[],"asin":"0375827609","parent_asin":"0375827609","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1103546667000,"helpful_vote":15,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2401,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Another wonderful book by Elizabeth Strout","text":"I am a big fan of the writing of Elizabeth Strout, and I was delighted at the opportunity to review her latest collection of interrelated short stories, &#34;Anything Is Possible.&#34;<br \/><br \/>First, however, it must be said that in order to fully enjoy and appreciate this book, you really must have read her previous book, &#34;My Name is Lucy Barton.&#34;  In fact, I think of these two books as companions.  In &#34;Lucy Barton,&#34; the reader is introduced to Lucy, a writer living in New York City, who is enduring a lengthy hospital stay following complications of surgery.  Her mother, from whom she is estranged, shows up one day unannounced and stays at Lucy's bedside for five days. In their conversations, they discuss many people from the past in the small town where Lucy grew up, Amgash, Illinois.  In this book, the reader gets a feel for Lucy's traumatic childhood and impoverished family and her remarkable journey to become an esteemed writer.<br \/><br \/>&#34;Anything Is Possible&#34; tells the reader more about most of the people who were only mentioned in the previous book.  It is not a coherent novel with a straightforward plot; rather, it is like a camera giving us a snapshot into the lives of many people from Lucy's past, including her brother Pete and her sister Vicky.  It provides us with a backstory on each character, so that what we were told about them in &#34;Lucy&#34; is expanded and fleshed out, making almost all the characters more sympathetic.<br \/><br \/>I liked all of these stories, but one of my favorites was the first, &#34;The Sign.&#34;  The main character in this story, Tommy Guptill, whose kindness and compassion are remarkable, is the school custodian who allows the child Lucy to stay after school for hours so that she can keep warm.  In &#34;The Sign,&#34; we learn about the tragedy that led Tommy to become a custodian, and we see his present day interaction with Lucy's reclusive older brother, Pete. Tommy is one of the most sympathetic characters I have met in a long time.<br \/><br \/>I also enjoyed &#34;Sister,&#34; a story in which the Barton siblings are reunited after many years of not having seen each other.  The reader sees how the past has affected each of them and learns new details about the abuse and isolation they endured.  I am in awe that they survived at all, given the past; Lucy's panic attack at the end is completely believable.<br \/><br \/>Strout's writing is wonderful.  I am most drawn to the honesty of her observations, her refusal to sugarcoat anything.  If you read &#34;Lucy,&#34; you will see that this is an obsession of sorts with her, and it is no less evident in this collection of stories.  Another collection by Strout, &#34;Olive Kitteridge,&#34; is more unified, but given the fact that the unifying character in this book does not even appear in some of the stories, this lack of complete unity did not bother me.<br \/><br \/>Although I loved this book, I recognize that it is not for everyone.  Some members of my book club were put off by the lack of plot in &#34;My Name Is Lucy Barton,&#34; and I especially caution readers who have not yet read &#34;Lucy.&#34;  Yes, of course you can read these stories on their own, but it is hard for me to see what meaning they would have for you unless you had read the previous book.  If you are looking for a tight plot, look elsewhere.  However, I highly recommend this book for people who appreciate superb, closely observed writing and can tolerate some scenes of almost unspeakable abuse of children.","images":[],"asin":"0812989406","parent_asin":"0812989406","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1488302473000,"helpful_vote":23,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3556,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Amazing flavor profiles that are relatively simple to assemble...in short, a knockout!","text":"I wasn't familiar with Michael Natkin before receiving Herbivoracious in a recent Vine newsletter, but I'm definitely a convert! Herbivoracious is taken from Michael's blog of the same name. His passion for great food has led him on several internships and positions in various kitchens.  A vegetarian since the age of eighteen, he's picked up a lot of great global influences along the way. Herbivoracious is full of nods to Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Mediterranean, Latin American and Middle Eastern vegetarian cuisine. You won't find any processed soy \"meat\" products or vegan cheeze. Instead, the full flavors of seasonal fruits and veggies are left to shine. In addition to all the vegetarian recipes, there is a selection of vegan and gluten-free choices as well. And did I mention how amazing the food is?<br \/><br \/>I tried four recipes from Herbivoracious: the baked penne with mushrooms and fontina, spicy tamarind-glazed potatoes, spectacular chocolate-espresso brownies, and the rosemary-blueberry sauce, which I used over Greek yogurt in the mornings. The baked penne packs a wallop of flavor; it's full of meaty seared mushrooms with a sprinkling of oregano, red pepper flakes, and sweet vermouth (I substituted marsala, since that's what I had on hand). The blanched baby spinach was incredibly flavorful, and the cubes of fontina melted throughout and added another dimension of flavor. This may be my new favorite pasta recipe ever.<br \/><br \/>The spicy tamarind-glazed potatoes (use less peppers if you want less heat!) combined creamy baby potatoes in a sweet-spicy sauce. The spectacular chocolate-espresso brownies were modeled in part on Ina Garten's take on [[ASIN:0688002900 The Soho Charcuterie Cookbook: Fabulous Food for Entertaining]]; they were good, but they still didn't beat my all-time gold standard of the Baked brownie from [[ASIN:1584797215 Baked: New Frontiers in Baking]]. The rosemary-blueberry sauce was an unexpected flavor profile that would be superb on cheesecake, crepes, or over yogurt (or ice cream!). The Sauces, Condiments, and Basic Recipes section has some fantastic bases (tomato jam with rosemary and saffron, lemon-mustard vinaigrette, Japanese sesame salt, quick harissa oil) that you'll find yourself coming back to again and again.<br \/><br \/>There's a beautifully compact intro on ingredients and equipment. Along the way, there are plenty of interesting sidebars, tips, suggested menus, making the most of seasonal produce, and more. You'll find familiar favorites like mac and cheese (here it's bolstered by smoked paprika and smoked cheese) rubbing elbows with kimchi stew, Sephardic fried leek fritters, and rice vermicelli with ginger-grapefruit sauce.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a book that really appealed to me with its global flavor profiles, ease of preparation, and commonplace supermarket ingredients. It's not pretentious like some celebrity chef vegetarian cookbooks. It's great for weeknights or for throwing together a salad or other potluck offering at a moment's notice due to the short prep time required of many recipes. This would be a great first cookbook for someone new to a vegetarian diet, or anyone looking for delicious meat-free meal ideas.","images":[],"asin":"1558327452","parent_asin":"1558327452","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1338333715000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3228,"length_group":3}

Peace Is Every Step was the first book of Thay's (what TNH's students call him-means teacher in Vietnamese) that I read and it was a gift from my brother.  This is a wonderful, easy to read book and a good introduction into mindfulness practice.  It's the kind of book where you can open it to any page and read the teachings.  Each subject is usually just a few pages long so it's the kind of book you can keep in the bathroom to read a little bit a time :-).  Thay has such a wonderful way of explaining mindfulness in \"easy to understand\" terms in this book.  Practicing mindfulness meditation has changed my life.  Be warned:  Once you start reading one of Thay's books, you'll be hooked!!  :-)).  He is an amazing poet, writer and such a gentle, warm, funny, compassionate \"being\" that is so full of happiness and joy.

{"rating":5,"title":"Lavender adds a sensual \"je ne sais quoi\" to these elegant dishes...","text":"I saw Sharon Shipley's \"The Lavender Cookbook\" at several of the vendor booths at the Becker Vineyards annual Lavender Fest, and rushed to order myself a copy after being drawn in by the book's colorful seasonal menus that all incorporate lavender in some form, from beverages (Lavender ginger lemonade, lavender iced tea sangria, lavender mulled wine) to desserts (chocolate lavender brownies, lavender honey custard ice cream, lavender coconut panna cotta with raspberry caramel sauce).<br \/><br \/>As a vegetarian, this book had plenty of delicious offerings that make the most of seasonal Mediterranean produce such as eggplant and artichokes. Rounded out with the included veggie- and fruit-based soups and lavender-infused breads, there is plenty to appeal to vegetarians and vegans who seek to incorporate the delicate flavor of lavender. For carnivores, there are lavender salt rubs, lavender chicken breasts in champagne sauce, grilled lavender lamb chops, grilled seafood, and more.<br \/><br \/>Every page was a voyage of discovery. Unexpected delights such as Taos lavender potato soup (poblano and chipotle peppers, cumin, an assortment of veggies), cantaloupe, mango, and Asian pear salad with lavender cilantro dressing, and farro lavender tabbouleh salad brought unexpected international twists to a seemingly straightforward herb.<br \/><br \/>The recipes are presented in an easy-to-follow manner, and oftentimes there is a short introduction as to the origin of the recipe. The seasonal menus take advantage of fresh local produce, and are correspondingly light for spring and summer (tropical fruit gazpachos and cold soups, light salads) and heavier for fall and winter (hearty stews and chili, hot beverages). The desserts are simply fabulous, from lavender devil's food cake to fragrant fruit-infused cakes, poached pears, panna cotta, and more. The cookbook is illustrated with pen-and-ink sketches of the Provence countryside on the chapter headings, and line drawings on some of the recipes. Nearly every recipe includes helpful hints on where to find trickier ingredients.<br \/><br \/>This is upscale, elegant, and romantic cuisine that would feel at home in a spa or resort town. Thankfully, it is fairly easy to prepare thanks to the well-written instructions, the ingredients are generally easy to find (finding dried lavender itself ([[ASIN:B000PDE97W Melissa's Dried Lavender, 0.33-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)]] may be the most challenging aspect), and your guests will be wowed with the unexpected sensuality and versatility that dried lavender has to offer.<br \/><br \/>Note: the book does not cover varietal lavenders other than the hybrid Provence.","images":[],"asin":"0762418303","parent_asin":"0762418303","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1181879363000,"helpful_vote":47,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2673,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A Delightful Read as well as a Delicious Collection of Recipes","text":"I love cookbooks and have far too many, even after having donated several dozen to our local library booksale.  My favorite kind of cookbook is one that you can read like a real book; one that has comments about each recipe and personal stories to accompany them.  &#34;Goldie's Kitchen Cookbook&#34; is exactly the sort of cookbook I love.  Written (or collected) by a writer of mysteries whose work I have never read, this cook book connects each recipe with one of the author's works.  Each has an introduction detailing the connection with the book, the personal experience of the author with the recipe, and any caveats about challenges you may encounter as you prepare the recipe.<br \/><br \/>The recipes themselves are not the &#34;simple and easy&#34; kind, but they are not overly complicated, either.  The author often urges the cook to use the best and freshest ingredients available, which is a great suggestion no matter what you are preparing.  Some recipes are ultra simple, such as Green Beans Amandine, which is exactly what you would expect, a simple preparation with salt, pepper, and butter to add flavor.  Others are longer and more complex, such as Shuttlecock Shrimp Curry, but none are truly complicated.  I look forward to reading and re-reading this book and to trying out a great many of the recipes.  Anyone who loves both cooking and commentary would love and appreciate this book.

{"rating":5,"title":"Stove pipe hats off to Louis Bayard for this unique and beguiling book!","text":"Stove pipe hats off to Louis Bayard for this unique and beguiling perspective of the early years of one of America’s most beloved Presidents Abraham Lincoln. The story is cleverly written through the eyes of the two people closest to him: a young politically minded Mary Todd and his beloved friend and roommate Joshua Speed.<br \/><br \/>The novel begins in 1839 and takes place mostly before Lincoln became president. It is told solely from Mary and Speed’s perspectives, both of whom paint Mr Lincoln in a sometimes unflattering, but always very humble and human light.<br \/><br \/>Joshua Speed is Lincoln’s landlord, friend and through circumstance, bedmate – beds being hard to come by for poor bachelors like Lincoln and therefore often having to be shared. They become fast friends and to many on-lookers almost like an old married couple, often finishing each other’s sentences and telling stories in perfect synchronicity. Speed always has in his mind that he and Lincoln will remain eternal bachelors together until a would-be matchmaker reminds Lincoln that any aspiring politician needs a wife. When Lincoln meets the enigmatic and politically minded Mary Todd, Speed realizes all he is about to lose.<br \/><br \/>Mary Todd is a sharp-witted and fiery woman with a mind for politics, which is something we are not used to seeing given most accounts paint her as a melancholy and difficult. Panicked by the thought of “entering the vale of spinsterhood,” at age twenty she travels from Kentucky to her sister and brother-in-laws’s home in Springfield with the “grim and single-minded resolve” of landing herself a husband. There she will meet the awkward and socially inept man of few words, Abraham Lincoln. One can definitely say that it’s not love at first sight for the pair, but as with all great love stories, it takes time to grow.<br \/><br \/>As Mary starts to get noticed in Springfield, a young Lincoln makes fumbling attempts to woo her guided by advice from his “dandy” friend Joshua Speed. Once Mary and Abraham get past the early obstacles (some caused by Speed), they begin to steal away for “unchaperoned tête-à-têtes,” but when their liaisons are discovered, the upper society of Springfield is scandalized by their secret engagements.<br \/><br \/>Bayard, as with all his novels, is the master of suspense. And even though many of us know how the story ends it still will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first to the last page. “Courting Mr Lincoln” is a truly moving novel about three extraordinary people and how their lives intertwined for better or for worse.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71q7ucGX4lL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71q7ucGX4lL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71q7ucGX4lL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1616208473","parent_asin":"1616208473","user_id":"AEHWUHNTB5FX32HJ7UBOZ2WWUX3Q","timestamp":1568218987778,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2596,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"It's a beautiful thing indeed to be \"Baked.\"","text":"I first saw Baked: New Frontiers in Baking while on vacation. My willpower not to buy any more baking books lasted for exactly one week until I swooped into my local bookstore, drooled, purchased, raced home, and whipped up a killer batch of the Baked Brownie. The balance of chocolate (11 ounces), butter (two sticks), a dash of espresso powder, a mix of granulated and brown sugar, and a hefty dose of eggs (five) give this brownie the ideal texture: the perfect marriage of fudgy and cakey without being runny or dense.<br \/><br \/>The next recipe I tried was the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf (the recipe makes two loaves). A seemingly straightforward blend of canned pumpkin puree, spices (allspice, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg), and chocolate, the complex flavors of spice and pumpkin were complementary without overwhelming. Although the recipe calls for one cup of vegetable oil, you also dilute it with 2\/3-cup tap water, so the bread is pleasantly moist without being greasy or oily (I've had that happen all too many times in many quick breads).<br \/><br \/>Next on my list was the Brewer's Blondie, a hopped-up blend of of malt powder, malt balls, semisweet chocolate, and walnuts. Bars are one of Baked's strengths, including a decadent grown-up Rice Krispy bar, the elegant Honeycomb Bar (sweet tart dough topped with dried fruit, honey, and a shot of booze), S'more nut bars, and the Baked bar. There are also more complicated layer cakes (chocolate malt, chocolate\/caramel\/sea salt, Whiteout, Red Velvet), cookies, and breakfast treats such as scones, granola (yay, finally a low-oil granola full of fruit!), and quick breads. Pies and tarts? Feast on Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Pie, Tuscaloosa Tollhouse Pie, Peanut Butter Pie with Cookie Crust and Easy Fudge Sauce, and Classic Diner-Style Chocolate Pie.<br \/><br \/>Baked has been featured on Martha Stewart, Oprah (their Baked Brownie had a centerfold spread in O), and on several high-profile shows, but does Baked live up to its claims of being revolutionary? That's a more difficult cookie to crumble. Sure, there are gourmet additions such as matcha, chipotle, and fleur de sel, but most of the Baked repertoire is firmly descended from comfort cooking, such as the Root Beer Cake, a modern update on the Southern staple Coca-Cola (or Dr. Pepper) cake, or the red velvet spiced up with Red Hots. Ditto on the divine Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Pie. It's still amazing, whether or not it's smashing any new culinary boundaries.<br \/><br \/>Even if you never cook a single recipe from Baked, the clever graphics (garden gnomes, plastic deer perched on a mound of fluffy coconut snow), useful sidebars (including variations), and notes make this a great investment. This is my favorite cookbook of 2008, and I hope that it will become yours as well.","images":[],"asin":"1584797215","parent_asin":"1584797215","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1224903595000,"helpful_vote":121,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2804,"length_group":3}

Louise Penny's description of Old Quebec in winter paints a perfect picture of the city's charm and beauty.  For those of us who have been there and  know and love the \"Old World \" city, the author perfectly captures the sights, sounds and even tastes and smells of Quebec City.

{"rating":5,"title":"Remarkable Story of a Young Russian Woman Serving a 10 day sentence","text":"I've been letting this story marinate in my mind for two weeks, because it's that good, that original, that aware. Anya is a woman who identifies as lesbian, but she is not out in every setting, including the one where her body and mind are in this novel. She is a young Russian woman beginning a sentence for ten days' detention. She attended a protest and when it was broken up, others got released and Anya did not.  She walks into a large cell full of bunks, radio running all day long with music she hates and she meets her cellmates in Women's Cell Number 3. Anya is very bright, college educated, with a wealthy father who is divorced from her mother. He is only intermittently involved with Anya. Her relationship with her mother is decent but complicated.<br \/><br \/>To set the stage for what it means to be in a Russian detention center we quickly learn that three of Anya's cellmates are in for driving without a license. One for not paying alimony. One for swearing at a cop. So, there are five of them and Anya makes six. For much of her stay, she interacts with and observes them. She has long periods when she thinks about pieces of her life, her closest friends, her  crushes, her college experiences, her mistakes. Some memories are funny. Many are unusual. Most reflect the childhood and college years of a young girl struggling somewhat with her identity and how to \"be\" in the world. The monotony of being in jail for ten days and the need for the small comforts of an occasional hot shower and phone time each day are palpable. The fact that on some shifts, the staff is at least decent and on others they are authoritarian and unhelpful becomes part of the emotional layers this book just adds on steadily.<br \/><br \/>Partway through her sentence, Anya goes what we might call stir crazy, beginning to have visions or hallucinations that might be dreams, but take up her thoughts for periods of time. Mostly, she eats the food which, while salty is better than she thought it would be and reads and just…. experiences all of this. Yarmysh is fully inside both Anya's head and creates for her characters in Women's Cell Number 3 unlike any Anya has met before. She is not \"out\" with them.  One of her cellmates is lesbian. One seems mentally ill. One is very obviously obsessed with herself, spoiled. One has served hard time in the past. Tea is made from water kept in a hot water bottle. Everyone seems to smoke. Anya quit awhile ago. There's a window that can be opened to the yard.<br \/><br \/>Time creeps along, as Anya learns pieces of information about each of her cellmates. Their stories both invade her thoughts and are apart from her. She is as alone as can be even though the six women are together through most of this book. This is a totally engrossing, oddly fast paced novel with a complex, interesting character in Anya. I personally like her a lot and root for her. But she's made mistakes and done some unlikeable things. She has also been at times a victim of someone else's highly unlikeable behavior. She examines these past moments\/periods as dispassionately as she considers her cellmates. She copes, except when intrusive thoughts come.  It is not normal to be in jail. It is something you adjust to and live through. And this is only ten days, but Yarmysh paints for us an engrossing personal experience. Everything is shared through Anya's perspective and it is all fascinating. You end up wanting to know what happens next with every single person, even if Anya doesn't want to know more than what she has learned. The writing is original and very visual because it's all written in third person omniscient.  Ten days in Women's Cell Number 3.  It's well worth spending the time to read this hard, yet lyrical book.  Highly recommend.","images":[],"asin":"0802160735","parent_asin":"0802160735","user_id":"AEZ26WGWJ3EOQ4KWSHG77HJAG4EA","timestamp":1677008081262,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3782,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Excellent, Absorbing, and Psychologically Astute","text":"&#34;The Year She Left Us&#34; by Kathryn Ma is the story of a multi-generational Chinese American family told from multiple points of view.  At the center of the story is the youngest member, Ari (short for Ariadne), a very young adult who is trying to come to terms with having been abandoned as an infant on the steps of a Chinese department store and adopted by a single parent, Charlie (short for Charlotte), a Chinese American public defender with more than a touch of social worker in her.  The other major narrative voices are those of Charlie's sister, Les (short for Lesley), a lawyer\/judge, and their mother (and Ari's grandmother), Gran.  Each of these women is complex and interesting, each strong in her own ways.<br \/><br \/>As the book opens, Ari has graduated from high school and is on her way to her grandmother's alma mater, Bryn Mawr.  She decides to visit China with her closest friend, A.J., who is also a Chinese adoptee, to see the orphanage she was adopted from and to determine whether her birth parents ever regretted their decision to give her up and tried to retrieve her.  The reader realizes that this is futile, but it is important to Ari, who is suffering from many of the issues that beset adopted children, especially those of abandonment and the fantasy of &#34;what might have been.&#34;  In China, Ari suffers what can only be called a breakdown and does something irrevocable to herself, a highly symbolic act that I will not reveal.<br \/><br \/>Meanwhile, at home in San Francisco, Charlie is living in major denial that anything is wrong with Ari.  She wants her to come home in time to get ready for college; she has no clue as to Ari's true state of mind.  Charlie has a secret of her own, one that is not revealed until midway through the book, but it has a major impact on all the characters.  Les's importance as a character increases as the book proceeds; despite being sisters, Les and Charlie  are very different personalities with diametrically opposed approaches to life.  Gran has the strongest personality of all.  She and her sister left China after World War II, leaving their entire family behind to deal with the horrors of the Communist regime.  Gran has more secrets than anyone else, and some are revealed only in the final chapters of the book when she herself returns to China for a visit.<br \/><br \/>Most reviewers would classify this book as a coming of age story, and indeed it is, but it is also a family saga, a cautionary tale about the corrosive power of the past and its secrets, and the dangers of not dealing with reality.  Frustrating as all of these characters are, they are also endearing; the reader cannot help but feel affection and sympathy for each one of them.  The writing is superb; if I have any issues, it would be with the pacing of the book about a third of the way through, when it seems just a bit sluggish.  The second half, however, is riveting; it was hard to put the book down.<br \/><br \/>I know personally some young adult adoptees, and the issues Ari is dealing with seem authentic and well defined.  I hope to share this book with my young adoptee friends, as well as with their parents and others who are trying to help them deal with their issues of abandonment and identity. I give this book my highest recommendation.","images":[],"asin":"0062273345","parent_asin":"0062273345","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1437840478000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3316,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Simply fantastic","text":"This is the latest of several \"Teach Yourself Visually\" books that my husband and I have ordered to help us use our electronic devices more fully.  Like the others, \"iPhoto for iPad\" does not disappoint.  In my opinion, these books are all you will ever need to help you use your devices more effectively.<br \/><br \/>First of all, the book assumes nothing more than that you have an iPad and the you want to work with your photos on it.  The chapters are made to order for those of us for whom technology is decidedly not \"second nature.\"  They begin at the most elementary level imaginable--looking at your photos and experimenting with different ways of viewing them.  From there, you learn how to import your photos and use the Cloud.  There is a great chapter on organizing your pictures into albums and editing your photos with special effects.  You learn to \"photoshop\" your pictures and use color and filters.  There is a chapter on creating advanced photo effects that I am not ready for just yet, but I look forward to learning about sharing photos and making journals of our travels.  We do not have an iPhone, but if you do, you will enjoy the chapter on iPhoto and the iPhone.  It is important to note that you do not have to cover all these areas if you are not interested.  The book is set up in such as way that browsing and selective learning are easy.<br \/><br \/>Second, I love that this book has photographs of exactly what you see on your own screen.  Not diagrams or sketches, but real photographs.  These photos accompany easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions.  They take nothing for granted, which I appreciate a great deal.<br \/><br \/>Third, I like the use of white space.  The pages of this book are not cluttered up with \"stuff\" on every inch of space.<br \/><br \/>Finally, I really enjoy the sidebar \"Question and Answer\" sections that accompany almost every step, and I found the index complete and easy to use.<br \/><br \/>In short, if you are mystified about how to integrate your photos with your iPad (or even your laptop computer), this is the book for you.  I cannot imagine that it would not be helpful to just about everyone.  It has my highest recommendation.","images":[],"asin":"1118443608","parent_asin":"1118443608","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1380311907000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2197,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"I Finished It in Two Days, Because It Was A Great Read!","text":"When I did have to stop reading this book over the past 48 hours, I could hardly wait to get back to it!  I enjoyed Melissa's memories about the different episodes. On reading about the \"May We Make Them Proud\" episode, I found it interesting that both Melissa and I agreed that if a mother was by her baby's cradle and a fire started, she would GRAB THE BABY (as she tried to point out to Landon during filming)!(That was a L.H. that I remember as being very \"dark\" and quite frightening,as I was 9 years old back in 1979).<br \/>  Anyway, this book was like a walk down memory lane in the 70's, with the songs that Melissa listened to, the clothing and hairstyles, and of course the memories about Little House! I liked the fact that the title was true to the book's contents. When I read \"Prairie Tale\" by Melissa Gilbert, I thought it would have many more details about her L.H. experiences, as the title suggests. I ended up forcing myself to finish it, after wading through the VERY sordid details of her many romances. Way too detailed, in my opinion! \"The Way I See It\" was not written as a tell-all book. Melissa came across to me as a rather shy, gentle person who wanted to share her memories of this particular period in her life with her fans. She seems to be a person I could sit across from and enjoy sharing 70's memories and \"mom stories\" with, since her son is exactly one year and nine days older than my son!<br \/>  I highly recommend this book to any Little House fan, especially those who grew up with the show in the 70's like I did. Great job, Melissa! I enjoyed your book thoroughly and will read it more than once, I guarantee!","images":[],"asin":"0762759704","parent_asin":"0762759704","user_id":"AF3HNAQK2URNEBAZQCRZGSPBU5FQ","timestamp":1273797845000,"helpful_vote":10,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1652,"length_group":3}

{"rating":5,"title":"A beautiful period piece that brings the Renaissance to sparkling life","text":"Christopher Grey's Leonardo's Shadow is the story of Giacomo, the servant of genius Leonardo da Vinci. However, this life is not as glamorous as it might seem; Leonardo is desperately poor, being two years behind on his largest commission, the Sistine Chapel, and the Duke of Milan refuses to pay until the work is complete. This leaves Giacomo to plead with merchants to extend their non-existent credit for food (Leonardo is a strict vegetarian) and fuel.<br \/><br \/>At first glance, the narrative's device of amnesia is a little too overused and convenient; Giacomo wakes from a near-fatal fall to find that he remembers nothing, and as the story moves along, tantalizing clues about his past are revealed (but all is not as it seems). He desperately wants to be a great artist, but Leonardo rarely acknowledges his existence other than to yell at him, let alone give him the drawing lessons he craves, so Giacomo teaches himself by looking at Leonardo's sketches in secret.<br \/><br \/>He becomes wrapped up in a series of mysterious events including a break-in and dueling with the Duke's spies, even as he faces his greatest challenge: how to get Leonardo to finish the Sistine Chapel? The book's characters and settings are lushly imagined, full of the (sometimes squalid) sights, sounds, and smells of Renaissance Milan. The historical setting immerses Giacomo's story without overpowering it, and the in-depth discussions of Renaissance painting techniques and alchemy were fascinating. The author also confronts the historical assertion that Leonardo was gay (although in this novel, he's asexual).<br \/><br \/>This was a riveting read that will be sure to delight fans of historical fiction and art lovers alike. There is a wealth of knowledge about Leonardo's inventions, paintings, and daily life in Renaissance Italy combined with a gripping story and vivid characters.","images":[],"asin":"1416905448","parent_asin":"1416905448","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1214303784000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1881,"length_group":3}

{"rating":5,"title":"A haunting postwar coming-of-age tale","text":"Set shortly after WWII, \"What I Saw and How I Lied\" is the dramatic coming-of-age of fifteen-year-old Evie Spooner. She and her friend Margie \"smoke\" candy cigarettes and long to be treated as young women rather than girls; Evie's mother dresses her in childish pinafores and forbids her to wear makeup. Her stepfather Joe has become a successful appliance salesman after coming home from the war, and when he suggests a sudden trip to Florida, Evie views it as an adventure. Evie experiences her first real crush on Peter, an ex-GI who served with Joe in Europe. But dark secrets chase Evie and her family until a dramatic climax forces Evie to grow up quickly and painfully.<br \/><br \/>The grueling car trip to Flordia (no air conditioning in the car or hotel) brought to life a time when interstate travel was not so smooth or glamorous; most of the hotels in Palm Beach are boarded up. Florida was still segregated; Evie notes the White and Colored drinking fountains, and local hotels are anti-Semitic as well. Evie and her mother spend aimless days at the pool while her normally even-tempered stepfather becomes increasingly crankier (and more alcoholic) as the summer wears on.<br \/><br \/>Judy Blundell has done a fabulous job of capturing the feel of 1947 postwar America, a place where Victory Gardens are still a very recent memory, and luxuries like nylons, gas, sugar and creamy sweet butter are new and unfamiliar after years of wartime rationing. Evie and her friend Margie swoon to a young Sinatra (\"All or Nothing at All\" makes an appearance) and songbook standards like \"I\"ll Be Seeing You,\" and follow the latest in postwar fashion (long skirts and fluffy tulle are in after fabric rationing), while her relatives listen to radio dramas. Evie's glamorous mother smokes in bed.  After being in such a rush to grow up (stealing her mother's bra and padding it with tissues, experimenting with kissing), Evie discovers that her mother's apparently glamorous \"female wisdom\" comes with a high cost that may not be worth the ultimate price. The central dilemma over what Evie saw and how she lied forces her to choose sides between her love for her parents and her love for Peter, and Evie goes from being a naïve preteen to a heartbroken adult all too believably as her eyes are opened to various adult truths. \"What I Saw and How I Lied\" is a  wonderfully atmospheric young adult novel that explores first love, loyalty, and the price of sacrifice in an engaging (and engrossing) pageturner that will keep you hooked until the final page.","images":[],"asin":"0439903467","parent_asin":"0439903467","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1240669572000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2554,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A must-have reference for serious home bakers \/ aspiring pastry chefs","text":"The Professional Pastry Chef by Bo Friberg is a must-have reference for all serious bakers \/ pastry chefs. It appears frequently as part of baking \/ pastry arts curriculums for good reason: Chef Bo clearly explains techniques and plating suggestions with a healthy (and entertaining) dash of food science along the way. The first of two volumes (the second being [[ASIN:0471359262 The Advanced Professional Pastry Chef]]), this gorgeous (and hefty) tome walks the novice pastry chef through glazes, meringues, basic doughs (short dough, puff pastry, pate a choux, pasta), yeast breads, breakfast breads and pastries, quick breads \/ pound cakes, sponge cakes, decorated cakes, individual pastries, ice cream, and custard-type desserts. The section on plated desserts is worth the price of the book alone, as you'll find templates for pastry cutouts, piping instructions, etc.<br \/><br \/>First and foremost, this is NOT a book for the average home baker. In most cases, the yields (and quantities, which are given in weights, not volume) are geared towards restaurants  \/ foodservice, although certain bread recipes are scaled down for smaller yields, such as the small-batch Black Forest bread with cocoa and dried cherries, challah, and Southwestern corn and cheese bread.<br \/><br \/>The included line drawings are enormously helpful to illustrate techniques. The Chef's Tips and sidebars further explain techniques or recipe-specific advice. Several in-depth charts like cookie recipes categorized by texture, production method, and storage capability provide an at-a-glance guide to what would be an otherwise overwhelming number of recipes to juggle.<br \/><br \/>The book particularly excels in its treatment of European (French\/Italian\/Viennese) pastries. Even the ice cream chapter yields unique flavor surprises, like the macadamia nut ice cream, banana-poppy seed ice cream, and avocado-mango ice cream. You'll find unusual frozen yogurts as well, like black-pepper honey, gingered pineapple, and strawberry-rhubarb frozen yogurt with ginger, that provide a welcome change.<br \/><br \/>The comprehensive appendices cover nearly 150 pages alone, including an extremely thorough glossary of ingredients and tools, precise metric conversions and metric equivalents, metric\/US length, weight, and volume equivalents,  and a particularly helpful section on yields, baker's percentages, and Baumé \/ Brix scale readings.<br \/><br \/>Despite owning several dozen baking books, I find myself coming back time and again to \"The Professional Pastry Chef\" for its clear instructions, charts, and fascinating food science tidbits.

Approachable and gorgeously photographed, each chapter opens with a mother recipe complete with step-by-step photos demonstrating the proper technique, then you are given numerous opportunities to try out your new skills on a tempting array of desserts in the same family.<br \/><br \/>Every major type of dessert base is covered in gorgeous photography and step-by-step guides, from caramel, custards and marshmallow to yeast and laminated doughs, cookie and tart doughs, and glazes, frostings, fillings and sauces. Johnny's pastry cream flavors were particularly inspired; pi&ntilde;a colada, coffee cardamom, tarragon vanilla and blackberry pastry creams mean that you'll never lack inspiration for a cream puff or &eacute;clair filling. And his primer on meringue includes French, Swiss and Italian meringues as well as sabayon, semifreddo, and mousse.<br \/><br \/>His flavor combinations are appealing and inventive, including banana fritters with tahini caramel cream, chocolate sesame seed cake, and a root cake features parsnips and carrots. One of the standouts for me was his apricot custard tart, made with almond flour and pistachios. Impressive yet fairly straightforward to assemble, this is a showstopping dessert made with a few simple ingredients. Another similarly French tart is the gorgeous strawberry-tarragon tart, inspired by a fraise des bois tart while Johnny was working at Ladur&eacute;e in Paris under Chef Pierre Herm&eacute;. I'm also eager to make the double-crust caramel-walnut tart for the holidays; a variation of the Swiss Engadiner, an almond-enriched tart dough surrounds a filling of caramel and walnuts.<br \/><br \/>As a diehard ginger lover (I eat candied ginger straight out of the bag), I loved the ginger-curry sugar cookies, and the play date cookies brought to mind the mamoul my Iraqi students used to bring to class. The addition of a spiced filling (cloves, cinnamon) was a welcome addition to what is traditionally a very sweet filling. Another instant favorite is the spicy malted chocolate chipotle brownies; dense and fudgy, a sprinkling of Demerara sugar lends crunch, while chipotle, smoked paprika, and cayenne provide a hit of heat and depth.<br \/><br \/>I own nearly 50 pastry and baking books, including several professional pastry textbooks, and I can say with absolute certainty that I will find myself coming back to \"Sugar Rush\" again and again for its winning combination of clear explanations and photographs and appealing recipes. Unlike some other pastry books I own, you will not have to seek out expensive, hard-to-find ingredients (no gold leaf\/dust, powdered ube, or molecular gastronomy required!) to end up with showshopping desserts, and the solid foundation on basic pastry techniques will serve you well on your future baking adventures.<br \/><br \/>If you are at all interested in baking \/ pastry, this is one book you need to have in your collection.

Persian-inspired stews like margat spenagh and fasanjon and hearty bean-and-meat stews are a welcome addition to colder months.<br \/><br \/>21-5-17-2647<br \/>Watermelon, mint, and feta salad<br \/>Beet and labneh salad with walnuts<br \/>Lentil salad<br \/>Iraq, like much of the Middle East \/ Mediterranean, has a pronounced sweet tooth, and the desserts on offer here include tahini and walnut cookies, Iraqi shortbread with cardamom, kleitcha, hilalat, datli, date cake, luquom, zardat za’afaran, halawat fistiq, jellies, and spoon sweets.<br \/>Special mention should be given to the fact that “The Iraqi Table” is not only a joy to cook from due to the relatively short ingredient lists and readily available ingredients, but the graphic design is gorgeous as well, from the food photography by Murrindie Frew and styling by Fiona Archibold to the large, easy-to-read font and gorgeous ethnic tapestries that serve as backgrounds. The index includes recipe names in both transliterated Arabic and English, as well as grouping by ingredient.<br \/><br \/> For my review, I made several of the salads including the watermelon, feta and mint salad, lentil salad, and beet salad. All were delicious, with a minimum of fresh, seasonal ingredients and just the right amount of seasoning to accentuate without overpowering. As is common in the Middle East and Mediterranean, I prepared several dishes and served them together to be scooped with flatbread. I have flagged many other recipes from “The Iraqi Table,” and look forward to continuing to cook my way through this gorgeous tribute to Iraq’s diverse, delicious and healthful cuisine.<br \/><br \/>Anyone who is interested in Middle Eastern cuisine will want to add this gorgeous book to their collection.<br \/><br \/>Congratulations to Ms. Al Safi on a beautiful cookbook and on your Gourmand Award!","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716Mud9z4eL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716Mud9z4eL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716Mud9z4eL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716Mud9z4eL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716Mud9z4eL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716Mud9z4eL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71AvD7r9ZjL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71AvD7r9ZjL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71AvD7r9ZjL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71HQ0yVNmxL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71HQ0yVNmxL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71HQ0yVNmxL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71NHNAJx0VL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71NHNAJx0VL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71NHNAJx0VL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71PboEYEFyL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71PboEYEFyL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71PboEYEFyL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71T-FVnqGWL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71T-FVnqGWL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71T-FVnqGWL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1860634281","parent_asin":"1860634281","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1495322783000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":9316,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Chocoholics rejoice!","text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de crème, white chocolate coeur a la crème with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de crème. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)","images":[],"asin":"1455617008","parent_asin":"1455617008","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1379192503000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3097,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Ovenly - comfort baking at its finest","text":"Named Best Bakery in New York City by 2013 Time Out New York Food & Drink Awards, Ovenly explores culinary traditions with an unexpected twist, melding salty and sweet with a touch of spice. Their main goal is to provide joy through flavor, and their first cookbook captures this beautifully.<br \/><br \/>Erin (who inherited her mother and grandmother's handwritten recipe cards) and Agatha (a \"refugee in the kitchen\" and daughter of Polish immigrants) have created a warm, approachable book that is full of inviting baked goods and nibbles; their tips, step-by-step photos and clear descriptions mean that any level of baker will be able to tackle these recipes and have them turn out great. I loved reading about Agatha's bilingual childhood where her parents tricked her into eating traditional Eastern European dishes like headcheese and tripe; my Polish grandmother (babcia) used to serve my mother \"chocolate soup\" (czarnina) until the day my mom found out it was actually duck's blood! And like Agatha, my babcia and great-grandmother were masters at Polish baked goods; some of my earliest memories are of helping my grandmother bake in her small apartment kitchen.<br \/><br \/>As I am primarily a (breakfast\/brunch) baker at heart, I loved Ovenly's unique take on scones (bloody Mary, cheddar mustard, currant rosemary), quick breads (strawberry basil, citrus berry), and coffee cake (poppy seed, prune, and lemon, banana Nutella). Their cookie flavors are downright revolutionary (mustard spice, bourbon chocolate chip with tarragon, the Stumptown shorty). The melding and blending of complementary flavors continues with their blue cheese apple pie with toasted walnuts, pear, sour cherry and cardamom pie, nectarine, blueberry and vanilla bean rustic tart, caramel bacon hot tarts, and goat cheese, spring onion and chive quiche. I am always on the lookout for spicy brownies that stack up against my standard Baked brownie, and the cinnamon and ancho chile brownies didn't disappoint.<br \/><br \/>In addition to the ample selections of breakfast and brunch bakes, you'll also find a chapter of cakes and cupcakes, including the pistachio cardamom cupcakes with ganache, black chocolate stout cake with salted caramel cream cheese buttercream, and chocolate cheesecake with sour cream topping. And I loved the inclusion of bar snacks (spicy bacon caramel corn, savory rosemary popcorn, maple thyme pecans, and peppery pistachio brittle) that make the perfect nibbles with cocktails or drinks.<br \/><br \/>One thing that did surprise me as an experienced home baker was their note on weighing ingredients: \"As we sent out our recipes for testing, we heard from friends, colleagues and family that none of them used the weight measurements we had provided. So, we decided not to use them in our book unless we felt it was necessary for a recipe.\" Instead, they have created a somewhat lengthy conversion chart at the front of the book. Normally I bake solely by weight assuming it is provided as I find it to provide more accurate, consistent results (especially true with flour, which changes weight depending on humidity and other factors); I wish they had just left that in for anyone who is so inclined, but that's my personal preference.<br \/><br \/>I loved some of the more unique advice like filing scratch marks into an aluminum or steel pan in order to aid with cutting finished brownies, bars, and shortbread that I haven't seen mentioned in my other baking books. The \"Get Creative\" sidebars marked with rolling pins will give you addition suggested variations to play with; you'll find cornflake topping for muffins, cashew butter and cayenne pepper filling for coffee cake, and nods to Eastern European pastries (jelly-filled muffins that brought to mind the paczki we eat on Mardi Gras, lemon poppyseed prune cake).<br \/><br \/>Whether you're already a fan of Ovenly (for those lucky enough to live in New York) or simply love delicious baked goods with unusual twists, Ovenly deserves a spot of honor in your cookbook collection!<br \/><br \/>(Thank you to Agatha and Erin for the advance copy - dziêkujê bardzo!)","images":[],"asin":"0373892950","parent_asin":"0373892950","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1416620074000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4131,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A wonderful coming of age memoir of a young Freedom Rider","text":"This is the single best coming-of-age memoir I have ever read. I have read and enjoyed many.  It is 1961, and eighteen-year-old Charles Person needs his parents'' permission to become the youngest of the original Freedom Riders of 1961.  James Farmer of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) led up the plan to test the right of black and white people to use non-segregated interstate buses and use the facilities and amenities in the bus depots. The U.S. Supreme Court decided a pair of cases establishing these rights, but blatantly segregated buses, waiting rooms, depot restaurants, station restrooms, and even shoeshine stands remained the norm in the Jim Crow South.  This was the freedom ride that led to the iconic photo of a Greyhound bus burning in a white mob's effort to stop the Freedom Riders from continuing on their journey - actually, to kill them if possible. Pearson was on the Trailways bus that Mother's Day, but his team was not spared.  They were beaten to a pulp, enduring lifelong medical problems from their injuries, these black and white men and women fighting for equal rights for people of color.  I was a seven-year-old white girl in a conservative city in Pennsylvania when they rode, with a mommy who was a civil rights activist and a daddy who supported her work.  I heard about the burning Greyhound bus and had a rudimentary understanding of the lunch counter sit-ins and Jim Crow.  Some years ago, I read the voluminous, amazing, and scholarly book on the 1961 Freedom Riders by Raymond Arsenault.  I've read articles and interviews and thought I got it. And then I read Buses Are a Comin: Memoir of a Freedom Rider.  I don't say this to make a point about me.  I say this to remind us all that there is more to learn: There is always more to learn. Always more that can bring deeper understanding.  This is an eloquent, beautifully written, and compelling book, with wonderful use of the protest\/freedom songs of the era. It is a different telling of a well-known story.  Its strength lies in illustrating this two weeks in May 1961 through the eyes of a very young man with a year of college and some protests and sit-ins under his belt.  Person's voice is authentic.  He shares enough to help us understand how he processed and experienced this journey:  leaving Georgia on a bus for the first time, working with famous activists, training for nonviolent responses to violent treatment, breaking bread with supporters, befriending the older white riders on his team, and moving on, moving on until they were too battered to take one more bus.  And when they could do no more, hundreds of others took up the job for the rest of that summer, riding buses all over the south in various groupings by race, sitting in the \"wrong\" seats, always an observer riding as a \"regular\" customer to help out if the others got arrested.  We know that and certainly, I've tried to imagine what it was like to be part of this harrowing summer made up of many individual journeys.  Person lets us in.  He takes us on the bus and tells his very personal story and he does it engagingly and freshly.","images":[],"asin":"B088MHLDJ6","parent_asin":"B088MHLDJ6","user_id":"AEZ26WGWJ3EOQ4KWSHG77HJAG4EA","timestamp":1622260075025,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3120,"length_group":3}

{"rating":5,"title":"Austin Characters being Austin Characters: Enjoyable for all","text":"Jane Austen enthusiasts will love this mystery and others will  find it an entertaining late Regency period romp through a British house party gone terribly wrong (or right if you see it as many might). As the title and descriptions of this mystery suggest, all of the characters were first found in Jane Austin novels, including the victim, the villainous Mr. Wickham.  So, each has a well developed backstory.  I read all of Austin, some of the novels more than once, and have seen every contemporary movie version of Emma.  I was concerned  I would have trouble \"getting\" the in jokes and comments based on the story lines Austin's work. Not so.  My recollections were totally refreshed and every single character, now with grown or growing children acted as you might expect them to with fifteen or twenty more years under their belts.  For those of you who have only read one or no Austin it does not matter.  You will learn enough of the backstories as necessary to thoroughly enjoy this without having read Austin at all.<br \/><br \/>Emma and George Knightley have inadvertently invited far too many guests, starting with the Wentworth's, a naval officer and his wife and tenants on the estate whose stairs collapsed.  The Knightleys are putting them up.  The Darcys and their son Jonathan are coming.  Juliet Tilney, a seventeen year old girl who Emma wishes to mentor a bit will be there.  As the guest list grows, they decide to make it a true house party, expected to last a month or so and to involve entertainment all the while.  But then, on a dark and rainy night, the nefarious George Wickham arrives.  He has recently found a way to legally defraud people of their money to such an extent that his wealth rivals that of the Knightleys' and his former inlaws, the Darcys. We know right away that the Darcys have a strong antipathy to him for many wrongs he did to them and their families over many years.  We know that Wentworth was one of his financial victims and Mr. Knightley's brother was also a victim.  Slowly, we find out that most of the guests had some strong reason to want Wickham dead.<br \/><br \/>Juliet and Jonathan, knowing they are both innocent, form a slightly improper and somewhat unlikely alliance to investigate Wickham's murder as amateur sleuths.  It is fascinating to see the world through Jonathan's eyes and Jonathan through the world's eyes, because Gray has written young Mr. Darcy as being a person on the autism spectrum long before there was a word for this disorder.  He is a wonderfully drawn character with parents who instinctively help him conform as necessary to allow him to make his way through the many rules of Regency society.<br \/><br \/>Gray does a marvelous job of being true to the period, the fashions, the social settings and the expectations of the roles of the married and unmarried and of the wealthy.  She perfectly captures, with Austin's cynicism and humor the characters and nature of a small town and of random guests at a house party.  She never overdoes things, yet the detail is all there.  This is a great read, both fun and well-plotted.  Everyone had such reason to be full of angst that I did not solve the mystery and I thought the resolution was perfect.  Still smiling at the cleverness of it.  Also, there is plenty of hope for additional entries and for this becoming a series.  I'm waiting!","images":[],"asin":"059331381X","parent_asin":"059331381X","user_id":"AEZ26WGWJ3EOQ4KWSHG77HJAG4EA","timestamp":1652533843490,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3374,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A fine read","text":"This book looks at the financial crash of 2008 and offers ways to reduce the odds of one happening again. The author, John G. Taft, has a fine education and experience to qualify him for such a book, and the book offers lots of details, with opinions from many noted people like Sheila Bair, John Bogle, etc.<br \/><br \/>The book says the word, finance is derived from the Latin word, finis, meaning end, and the Latin term meaning goal. So, finance is intended to reach an end, a goal, inferring a longer term objective. Taft sees one of the main reasons for the crash was too much short term thinking, driven largely to increase the stock price, especially since executives are rewarded with stock options. Plus, since the stock price is driven higher when the company exceeds analyst estimates, rather than real results, it is a phony way to value a stock, especially no matter what real or estimated results are, the CEO can just offer positive 'guidance.<br \/><br \/>So, the author says executive pay should not be depended on short term moves in stock prices. Further, the author says a company's mission should be not just for the benefit of stock holders, but put clients\/customers first. Historically, investment houses, like Goldman Sachs, were partnerships, with the added incentive to put the client first because assets of the partners were at risk, too. He recommends a &#34;fiduciary capitalism&#34; where banks have an explicit fiduciary role. Also, he advocates a &#34;sustainability capitalism&#34; where  a corporation also should include financial negatives and positives for how a company has affected the environment, too.<br \/><br \/>He thinks there also should be super fiduciaries which try to hold companies to such standards, even sustainability concerns.He sees CALPERS, the CA pension system and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as examples.<br \/><br \/>I recommend this book for any CEO or high ranking government official and anyone who is interested in the 2008 crash and ways to improve our form of capitalism.","images":[],"asin":"1137279729","parent_asin":"1137279729","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1421087863000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2044,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A vegetarian taste of Morocco that's sure to delight!","text":"Ghillie Basan, author of several cookbooks on Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisine including [[ASIN:1848859848 Classic Turkish Cooking]] and [[ASIN:1845979486 Tagines & Couscous: Delicious Recipes for Moroccan One-pot Cooking]], offers up a vegetarian (mostly vegan) Moroccan feast in \"Vegetarian Tagines & Couscous.\"  Although at first glance this would appear to be a slim volume (65 recipes total), \"Vegetarian Tagines & Couscous\" is a wonderful all-in-one source for Moroccan pantry staples, light mezze and appetizers, creative ways to make the most of seasonal vegetables and produce, and wonderful couscous and fruit salads that are welcome any time of year. The ingredients and instructions are clearly laid out, and most ingredients should be readily available at your local supermarket. Most of the recipes can be easily made vegan by swapping out agave for honey, using olive oil in place of butter, or by omitting the cheese and eggs (there are relatively few recipes that call for either).<br \/><br \/>Beginning with essential recipes such as preserved lemons, smen, harissa, chermoula, and ras el hanout, the book offers a diverse selection of light appetizers including cracked green olives and cardamom and harissa, crudités with red chilli dukkah dip, filo fingers stuffed with feta, olives, and preserved lemon, smoked aubergine and yogurt dip with harissa, and strained yogurt and cucumber dip with rose petals. There are also several flavor-infused soups like creamy pumpkin soup with ginger and chilli honey and chilled almond and garlic soup.<br \/><br \/>The included tagines (both light and hearty) offer a wide range of preparations of vegetables and legumes including the wonderful tagine of artichokes, broad beans, apricots and almonds, onion, olive, and egg tagine with zahtar, and tagine of spicy roasted pumpkin wedges with lime. There are also a number of fruit tagines including the tagine of roasted pear with figs, walnuts and cardamom, stuffed prune tagine with walnuts and rosewater, and pumpkin, apple, and sultana tagine with chermoula, that are a wonderful way to braise fruit to a soft, creamy consistency. I enjoyed the stuffed prune tagine with its spiced wine reduction over Greek yogurt in the mornings!<br \/><br \/>The cooking instructions for the several couscous dishes yield a light, fluffy couscous unlike the \"typical\" American boxed couscous. True Moroccan couscous is made fresh and is slowly steamed and fluffed until light and airy. The couscous recipes here are a compromise between the two methods, yielding light, fluffy couscous without the long time steaming, fluffing, adding liquid and repeating. Ghillie has you first soak the couscous in warm water, then fluff the grains with a fork to separate, rub oil into the grains using your fingers, then aerate before baking to heat through. I attempted the couscous with dried fruit and nuts and it turned out every bit as beautiful (and delicious) as the cover photo! You'll also find the traditional couscous with seven vegetables as well as a saffron couscous with roasted coconut and pistachios, couscous with hot apricot chutney and halloumi (the recipe for the homemade chutney is worth the cost of the book alone!), and harissa couscous with pine nuts and fried eggs.<br \/><br \/>One important word of caution is that your type of tagine and stovetop may result in many of these being prepared in a dish other than a tagine as many of the tagines are cooked on the stovetop versus oven; I have a ceramic stovetop and two clay tagines and was advised not to use clay\/terra cotta tagines even with a heat diffuser, so for the many stovetop preparations I used my 4.5-quart Staub Dutch oven instead. If you have a Staub or Le Creuset cast iron tagine, then you should be fine using them directly on a ceramic stovetop.<br \/><br \/>One of my favorite parts (and a wonderful way to close out a meal) is the gorgeous fruit salads; I made the orange and date salad with chillies and preserved lemon and grapefruit and pomegranate salad with rosewater (see photo); these quickly became favorites and I make them at least every other week now. They are easy to put together and the flavors work wonderfully together, not to mention the striking presentation (I like to fan out the orange segments into a star shape). The contrast between sweet and tart (the preserved lemons), or fruity and floral, serves to balance out spicier dishes or as an anytime treat.

{"rating":5,"title":"A beautiful, heartbreaking look at love and loss in prerevolutionary Iran","text":"Mahbod Seraji's haunting \"Rooftops of Tehran\" is set in 1973 Tehran, in an exotic world where families gather on carpeted rooftops to escape the heat and humidity of the day, weaving stories and poems late into the starry nights. Seventeen-year-old Pasha Shahed is a bookworm who harbors a secret crush on his beautiful neighbor Zari. At first, he keeps this forbidden desire locked firmly away since Zari is engaged to Doctor, a university student with dangerously Marxist political leanings. But when Doctor is forced to go on the run after catching the eye of SAVAK, the Shah's secret police, Pasha finds himself drawn to Zari like a moth to a flame.<br \/><br \/>Despite the fact that the novel unfolds several years before the Revolution, the political atmosphere is charged, with thousands imprisoned, tortured and killed for suspected subversive political activities and affiliations. The SAVAK are everywhere. Pasha and Zari are caught up in this tempest with devastating effects for all involved; during the Shah's birthday motorcade, a single defiant statement by Zari shatters Pasha's world.<br \/><br \/>Pasha must recover from both the physical and psychological scars in the aftermath, and his only hope of escape is studying in the United States. He and his parents struggle to make sense of the violence and palpable fear that has crept into their lives, of nighttime raids and friends that disappear forever. Pasha's friendship with Ahmed becomes a lifeline as Pasha struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts in the wake of his many personal losses.<br \/><br \/>Seraji's Tehran is beautifully described, and threads of Iranian culture are woven throughout; Iranian poets, celebrations (No Ruz), and traditions  create a rich cultural tapestry that provides vibrant color to Pasha's tale. Pasha makes an engaging narrator, and touches of humor lighten otherwise dark moments ( Pasha's mother's  disgusting herbal \"tonics\" that are supposed to cure him of his introverted nature,  \"Professor\" Ahmed's \"scholarly\" treatise on the dangers of self-pleasure). This is a must-read by a fresh new voice, and particularly insightful given the current political situation in Iran thirty years after the Revolution.  A short interview with the author and a reader's guide are also included.","images":[],"asin":"045122681X","parent_asin":"045122681X","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1245501300000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2297,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Redefining kosher: Fresh, seasonal, beautiful flavorful and delicious!","text":"I have cooked from (and reviewed) numerous kosher cookbooks over the years, but I have to say that Kim Kushner’s “The New Kosher” is quickly becoming one of my favorite titles in my collection. True to its title “Simple Recipes to Savor and Share,” you’ll find contemporary gems such as giant ricotta ravioli with cinnamon, miso-tahini glazed cod, braised beef ribs with cider-rosemary sauce, and some fabulous ideas for brunch (the spinach and feta quiche with heirloom tomatoes, asparagus and goat cheese quiche, and caramelized red onion and dill frittata with smoked salmon are going to be in frequent rotation on the weekends in my house!).<br \/><br \/>Kim’s essentials include great noshes like five-minute sun dried tomato hummus with homemade pita chips with za’atar, butternut squash chips with herbes de provence, and a variety of quick and easy toppings that come in handy for other recipes (spicy maple crumb topping, za’atar everything topping, and lazy crumb topping which is particularly good on baked fish such as the Lazy But Crispy Fish.<br \/><br \/>In addition to a strong Middle Eastern influence (Kim’s mother was born in Morocco and grew up in Israel) in dishes like charred eggplant dip with maple drizzle, poisson a la marocaine (whitefish marinated then cooked in saffron water with preserved lemons and paprika oil), crispy rice cake with saffron crust, hummus, etc., there is a marked Asian influence, which I particularly enjoyed. Nods to the East include ginger-scallion dip with sesame seeds (this would be amazing as a dip for scallion pancakes!), kohlrabi, edamame and carrots in ginger-miso marinade, arctic char with wasabi-mirin sauce over rice noodles, miso tahini glazed cod, tamari salmon with edamame, and Thai-style summer salmon. There are also kid-friendly recipes like individual mac and cheese, kids’ steaks (marinated and cooked in a low oven rather than grilled), and deconstructed s’mores.<br \/><br \/>Vegetarians and pescetarians like myself will find many colorful, appealing dishes, particularly the salads and veggies (and fish for those of us that eat fish). I recently tried my first (fresh-off-the-tree) pomelos in Taiwan, and loved seeing the pomelo salad with red onion, mint and cilantro as well as the light, umami-packed Asian salads like kohlrabi, edamame and carrots in ginger-miso marinade, savoy slaw with lemongrass and lime dressing, and avocado, heats of palm, edamame and za’atar salad. Fans of Ottolenghi’s [[ASIN:1452101248 Plenty: Vibrant Vegetable Recipes from London's Ottolenghi]] and [[ASIN:1607746212 Plenty More: Vibrant Vegetable Cooking from London's Ottolenghi]] will feel right at home here.<br \/><br \/>And although the dishes are easily doable by a home cook, you’ll also find elegant presentations such as braised beef short ribs with cider-herb reduction, veal roast with porcini, thyme, and garlic rub, lamb rib chops with red wine vinegar, mint and garlic, and seared tuna steaks with sun-dried tomato and jalapeno preserves that are perfect for more formal gatherings or special occasions.<br \/><br \/>The desserts chapter offered some great alternatives to my usual lineup, my new favorite being the dark bark with rose petals, pistachios and walnuts. I started making my own chocolate bark recently using my rice cooker (!) to melt \/ temper the chocolate (frequently I’ll make pomegranate bark using fresh pomegranate seeds), and I loved the addition of rose petals to add a real Persian flair. You’ll find time-tested Jewish classics like coffee cake, macaroons, and hamantaschen with three fillings (hello Ferrero Rocher!) alongside biscotti, a healthier take on crostata, and an almond granita.<br \/><br \/>The book’s graphic layout is clean and eye-catching, with full-page photos and beautifully tiled chapter headers. Ingredients are given in US and metric measurements, which I really appreciated.<br \/><br \/>Even if you don’t keep kosher, these are great recipes for beautiful, vibrant foods that your family and friends are sure to enjoy. One note for kosher home cooks: recipes are not labeled as dairy, meat or pareve as with most other kosher cookbooks in my collection; generally chapters are separated by meat, seafood, etc., but in some chapters like soups and dips, you may need to scan the ingredients to determine if it is dairy, meat, or pareve.<br \/><br \/>(Thank you to the author for the review copy and mazel on a gorgeous cookbook!)","images":[],"asin":"1616289260","parent_asin":"1616289260","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1447001918000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4438,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Hungarian Kosher family recipes and remembrances...","text":"\"Food, Family, and Tradition\" is part memoir, part cookbook, all love. It traces Lynn Kirsche Shapiro's family roots in Czechoslovakia and Hungary and the tragedy of the Holocaust, as well as family dishes that were preserved and handed down for future generations. The book began as Shapiro's way to complete two unfinished legacies: her mother's recipes and her father's autobiography, but along the way became so much more, chronicling the richness of Jewish life in Eastern Europe prior to the Holocaust and the role of faith and strong family traditions that allowed Holocaust survivors to rebuild their lives after the war. The preparations and meals carried an essential ingredient of remembrance that connected them to lost loved ones.<br \/><br \/>The first half of the book traces the author's family roots in Czechoslovakia (her father Sandor Kirsche) and Hungary (her mother Margit) through period photographs, biographies, a family tree of victims and survivors, and original vignettes about Jewish culture, kosher wine, holidays and traditions. Sandor opened Hungarian Kosher Foods (the largest kosher supermarket in the Midwest) in Chicago in 1973 and it still thrives today. More than just an all-kosher supermarket, it has also become a place for the Jewish community to gather and connect.<br \/><br \/>Part two features 150 family recipes from Czechoslovakia and Hungary divided into ten chapters ranging from appetizers and soups to entrees and desserts. All recipes are kosher and marked as parve, meat, or dairy, and Yiddish \/ Hungarian names are given when applicable. Each recipe is introduced by a family story or the dish's origins, and many contain helpful hints (identified by red dotted boxes). You'll find staples like matjes herring, borscht, and blintzes, but one thing that stood out from my many other Jewish and kosher cookbooks was the inclusion of Hungarian dishes like rakott krumpli, goulash, cabbage with noodles, and fruit soups. I found many new recipes like the sweet bread kugel and golden dumplings that I look forward to making on a regular basis.<br \/><br \/>I own many Jewish cookbooks and have read much on the Holocaust, but \"Food, Family and Tradition\" really resonated with me for several reasons. Many of the recipes evoked those of my Polish grandmother (stuffed cabbage, borscht, kasha, chrain), and my Polish great-grandparents were grocers in 1920s Chicago.  This is a beautiful cookbook that captures the spirit of prewar Czechoslovakia and Hungary's once-vibrant Jewish communities; their legacy lives on through these recipes that have been lovingly preserved and updated for modern kitchens.<br \/><br \/>(Review copy courtesy of Trina Kaye PR)","images":[],"asin":"098984790X","parent_asin":"098984790X","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1418086145000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2698,"length_group":3}

{"rating":5,"title":"Harness your slow cooker to make healthy, delicious meals!","text":"As a fairly recent convert to slow-cookerdom, I've embraced the appliance (Michele Scicolone's three books The French Slow Cooker, The Italian Slow Cooker, and The Mediterranean Slow Cooker are in constant rotation in my house!). I have ATK's Slow Cooker Revolution Volume 2and tried several dishes that I loved. So when I heard that ATK was coming out with a healthy slow cooker book, I knew this was the one for me. I'm pescetarian and follow a low-fat diet, and I knew from previous ATK titles that there were sure to be veggie, grain and fish dishes that appealed to me. When I finally had the chance to flip through &#34;Healthy Slow Cooker Revolution&#34; shortly before New Year's, I'd quickly tabbed dozens of recipes to try. (You can preview the 200 included recipes here: http:\/\/slowcookerhealthy.com\/full-recipe-list\/)<br \/><br \/>In the last two days, I've tried out four recipes from &#34;Healthy Slow Cooker Revolution&#34;: the Spanish tortilla with roasted red peppers, vegetarian pho, poached salmon with caper sauce, and the fingerling potatoes (see photos). Having lived in Spain twice, I've never mastered the stovetop art of the Spanish tortilla and feared it was forever out of my league; even when I tried to cook it on low heat, the bottom ended up scorched and the top was runny. No more! ATK's recipe produced a gloriously thick, hearty tortilla that can be easily cut into squares and served with the optional aioli just like in tapas bars in Spain. The contrast of the bell peppers and the peas makes each slice look like stained glass. I'd tried another vegetarian pho recipe in the past, but I loved the addition of the meaty mushrooms (a mix of fresh portabello and dried shitake) and lemongrass. Instead of veggie stock, I recommend using a carton of Trader Joe's miso ginger broth for an extra dash of umami. The poached salmon was so easy; due to the moist heat and steam, fish turns out moist and flavorful (I've overbaked it and dried it out in the oven previously). The herb relish can be adapted using whatever you have on hand; lacking capers, I used chopped picholine olives and lemon olive oil from Italy. And the fingerling potatoes with lemon were every bit as good as those done in the oven; I loved the addition of lemon peel and lemon juice that gives them a bright pop. I loved the veggie sides like maple-glazed acorn squash and braised butternut squash with pecans and cranberries and the grain mains like farro primavera, wild rice pilaf with cranberries and pecans, and spiced barley pilaf with dates and parsley. Vegetarians are well represented; you'll even find a vegetarian French onion soup and Vietnamese pho. And because this focuses on healthy cooking, desserts are mostly poached fruit and lighter offerings (although you will find two cheesecakes; you can preview the recipe for lemon cheesecake here: http:\/\/slowcookerhealthy.com\/recipes\/lemon-cheesecake\/)<br \/><br \/>Comparing the book side-by-side with Slow Cooker Revolution Vol. 2, several things jump out: first, the recommended slow cooker brands have changed dramatically; gone is the All-Clad (which I own), which is missing entirely from the new book. Each recipe now includes nutritional info, and the readability (font and spacing) has changed for the better in the new book: they've switched to a sans serif font and darker print that make it easy to read from a cookbook holder. Each recipe comes with nutritional info as well as a suggested veggie pairing or accompaniment, a very convenient feature since you don't have to flip between sections to find the perfect side dish. There is also more of an Asian influence as there are many Thai-inspired vegetable curries (http:\/\/slowcookerhealthy.com\/recipes\/thai-eggplant-curry\/) and soups, tagines, and even a Turkish-style eggplant casserole that I look forward to trying. Recipes are also marked as vegetarian and easy prep.<br \/><br \/>Although shortcut processed foods are absent, there is still some detailed prep required (slicing \/ mincing veggies, browning meat, microwaving ingredients to parcook them before adding to the slow cooker), so if you are looking for a &#34;dump it and go&#34; book, you may be disappointed. As other reviewers have mentioned, most of these recipes are done in 4-6 hours with the exception of soups, so you can't leave them cooking all day to come back to them in time for dinner (particularly true for fish, which only takes 1 to 2 hours on low). Also, while testing recipes I found that my slow cooker runs a little hot, so be sure to check recipes at the low end of the range first.<br \/><br \/>Overall, &#34;Healthy Slow Cooker Revolution&#34; continues the tradition of ATK's last two slow cooker books, allowing you to make a wide range of mains and sides with various international influences. As I am always looking for healthy low-fat vegetarian ideas, I found more recipes in this book that appealed to me than in some of their other slow cooker offerings. Having the nutritional info provided was extremely helpful as well. I loved everything I made and have many more recipes flagged to try in the coming weeks.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/812T8Q0vicL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/812T8Q0vicL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/812T8Q0vicL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81JeP0WM-+L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81JeP0WM-+L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81JeP0WM-+L.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81KgiWBxLSL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81KgiWBxLSL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81KgiWBxLSL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1936493950","parent_asin":"1936493950","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1420544765000,"helpful_vote":330,"verified_purchase":false,"length":5133,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"An enduring classic","text":"James Howe, better known as the author of [[ASIN:1400094720 The Bunnicula Collection: Books 1-3: #1: Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery; #2: Howliday Inn; #3: The Celery Stalks at Midnight]], has created a moving tale of friendship and acceptance in \"A Night Without Stars.\" Published in 1985, there are some segments that date the book (comparing Maria's older brother to a young John Travolta from [[ASIN:B000SQFC0Y Saturday Night Fever (30th Anniversary Special Collector's Edition)]]), but the overall story is a timeless one. There are touches of humor and solid observances on adolescence.<br \/><br \/>Eleven-year-old Maria Tirone lives with her brothers, her baby sister Anna, and her parents in a house in Queens. Her loud, loving Italian-American family rallies around her when she must go to the hospital for open-heart surgery to fix a ventricular septal defect: a hole in her heart. She's always had heart problems, but lately she's excluded from roller skating and other activities she took for granted, like running or jumping up the stairs two at a time.<br \/><br \/>Her friends Tina, Joni and know-it-all Marlene (their authority on everything since Marlene wears a bra) don't do much in the way of comforting Maria before she's admitted to the hospital; Marlene tells her that she'll be getting a heart transplant from a potential murderer, or \"somebody who isn't Catholic,\" heaven forbid.<br \/><br \/>Maria tries to put on a brave front, particularly in front of her older brother Carlo, who promises that the two of them will buy a car and escape for drives after her surgery. But once her family has left, Maria's on her own at the hospital, where she meets Linda, a frequent patient, and Bonnie. The two tell her about some of the other nurses and patients, particularly about one boy called \"Monster Man.\" From what the other girls have told her, he's mean, disagreeable, and ugly as the result of a house fire. Maria's first face-to-face meeting with Donald goes less than stellar; he bitterly advises her to \"take a picture, it'll last longer.\"<br \/><br \/>But something magical happens: Maria, frightened about her first surgery and without her family, finds solace during a midnight heart-to-heart with Donald, who has suffered through multiple skin grafts. Raised by foster parents, Donald is still scared of dying and doesn't trust the doctors and nurses who operate on him. But he uses his love of poetry to tell her what to expect during the anesthesia: \"You don't dream. There are no colors, only space. Night. But not a night with light and noises.  A night without stars. No stars. Just black, black, blackness. And it holds you. And becomes your only friend.\"<br \/><br \/>After their surgeries, Maria and Donald cement their blossoming friendship. Maria learns to look past Donald's severe scarring, and tries to heal his emotional scars as well by offering her friendship. Donald opens up slowly by sharing his very personal poetry. But Maria's stay at the hospital is over far too soon. She's heartbroken at his suffering and taunts that the other children throw at him, at the unfairness of it, and she chooses Donald over Linda, Bonnie, and even her old friends. The ending is touching without being overdone, and a perfect close to this short but sweet tale of acceptance and friendship.","images":[],"asin":"0689808321","parent_asin":"0689808321","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1232287602000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"length":3322,"length_group":3}

I loved this book and am looking for an opportunity to give it to parents of a new baby.<br \/><br \/>Though I think almost anyone would love this book, parents who enjoy writing and reflecting will appreciate it the most,.  There are opportunities to reflect on the baby's future as well as on what was going on in the world when he or she was born, and to reflect on many other events in the baby's life, and what these events might mean.  For example, one page has a space for parents to write about what they learned from their child.  Anyone who has a child knows that they teach us much about life, love, and what really matters.<br \/><br \/>Parents should think of this book as a gift for their child, to be given when the child asks about his early years and may perhaps be starting a family of his or her own.

I bought Carole Walter's \"Great Coffee Cakes\" while on vacation in Petoskey, MI (if you happen to be in town, check out the divine kitchen store Cutler's, where I purchased this).<br \/><br \/>The first recipe I tried was the sticky buns, which were a flop. However, that was due to the fact that I was trying to proof yeast with no thermometer (baking on vacation in a sparsely equipped rental unit is always an adventure), so it is quite likely that I used too low a temperature to activate the yeast. The sticky topping was excellent, though. Once back home, I made several other recipes, and all were delicious, particularly the cherry almond cake and the Greek semolina cake (if you like Middle Eastern cuisine, this is quite similar to basboosah, a semolina cake soaked in a honey syrup).<br \/><br \/>The recipes are rated according to level of difficulty, which is illustrated by measuring cup graphics (one cup means easy, while three is difficult). The ingredients are largely things that you probably already have in your cupboards or pantry; there are few exotic ingredients other than crystallized ginger or flavored liqueurs such as Grand Marnier. The ingredients are clearly laid out, and if a recipe calls for another recipe from the book, the page number is given. There are numerous helpful sidebars with practical advice to help you make the most of your creations, such as working with yeast, what to do with scraps, freezing yeasted doughs, and baking advice. Nor is the book limited to breakfast; Carole also provides luscious cookies such as glazed ricotta cookies, biscotti, black chocolate madeleines, and several variations on rugelach, bar cookies, and spreads (cranberry orange, maple pecan, dried pear, toasted walnut, and blue cheese) to round out your day.<br \/><br \/>As other reviewers have noted, there are a few small errors and omissions, but nothing major (Carole has thoughtfully posted the corrections on her official website). If you live for muffins, sticky buns, and comforting old-fashioned pound cakes, this book is for you. If you're looking for divine danishes (a bit more advanced), croissants and strudels, you'll find those as well. There's something here for all levels of bakers from novice to pro, and I loved the international touches such as babka (Polish yeast bread), Greek coffee cake, stollen, and pain au chocolat. I would have liked to see a few more illustrations (there are color photos in the center), but that's a minor quibble for an otherwise outstanding guide to breakfast baked goods.","images":[],"asin":"0307237559","parent_asin":"0307237559","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1238892566000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2845,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Sweet soul food to warm the heart","text":"In Brown Sugar: Soul Food Desserts from Family and Friends, Joyce White, author of [[ASIN:0060187166 Soul Food: Recipes and Reflections from African-American Churches]], turns her attention to sweet endings.

{"rating":5,"title":"A beautiful (and delicious!) homage to the varied desserts of southern Italy","text":"I happened to discover Rosetta Costantino's \"Southern Italian Desserts\" while researching a trip to Southern Italy. Rosetta, a cooking instructor and author of [[ASIN:0393065162 My Calabria: Rustic Family Cooking from Italy's Undiscovered South]], has collected 75 desserts from Calabria, Campania, Basilicata, Puglia, and Sicily. Sure, you'll find cannoli and gelato here, but there are many other regional gems to discover in each chapter; desserts can vary not only from region to region but from town to town.<br \/><br \/>Sicily offers so much more than cannoli; the divine biscotti Eureka (almond-and-blood-orange-marmalade-filled spirals), chocolate-hazelnut cake rolls, a gorgeous ricotta and pistachio mousse cake named for the 1958 novel Il Gattopardo, a baked ricotta tart, and several gelatos and puddings are all on display, including the elaborate watermelon pudding-filled tart on the book's cover. The illustrated primer on making the perfect cannoli (including shells) was very helpful as well; I've only worked with store-bought cannoli shells before, so having a detailed how-to was a lifesaver.<br \/><br \/>Campania's offerings are rich with cherries, pears, and some lovely semolina-enhanced cakes and pastries. One of the more unusual offerings here is the eggplant layered with sweetened ricotta and chocolate sauce. Calabria contributes luscious odes to figs and clever peach-shaped cakes filled with ricotta cream. I fell hard for the chocolate-dipped dried figs filled  with almonds and candied orange peel; one of my favorite treats around the holidays are chocolate-dipped figs from Spain, so I loved having the option to make them myself at home. I also fell for the ricotta-filled baked pears; a filling of crushed amaretti, almond paste, and candied orange peel fill ripe pears poached in wine. The elegant ricotta and pear cake was light and refreshing.<br \/><br \/>Other recipes that have become favorites are the biscotti di ceglie (almond cookies with cherry preserves from Puglia). The flavor combination of toasted almonds, a touch of limoncello, honey and cherry preserves is addictive and fun to make; where else can you continually moisten your hands with limoncello instead of plain water? The barchiglia (chocolate-glazed almond tart with pear preserves) was another great find; the combination of pastry crust, pear marmalade, almond pastry cream, and chocolate is layered with flavor.<br \/><br \/>A final chapter of master recipes provides a handy do-it-yourself guide to ricotta cream, nut pastes, fig and grape syrups, and candied orange peel and orange (or blood orange) marmalade, which is a much-appreciated touch as many of these are not available in regular supermarkets.<br \/><br \/>The cookbook itself is beautiful, printed on high-quality matte paper (my preference, as there is less of an issue with glare when placed in a cookbook holder). Ingredients are listed in volume and metric, and a conversion chart is at the back. The font is easy to read and stands out on the page.<br \/><br \/>Along the way, colorful notes on local ingredients, traditions and legends (including how a local pear variety takes its name from a story involving a statue of St. Anthony) share space with beautiful candid photos of cafes, churches, piazzas, Greek temple columns and inviting alleyways. Many of the recipes have full-page color photos, and the step-by-step photos for more complex recipes like the sfogliatelle ricce was extremely helpful in visualizing the technique described in the recipe. A list of sources, a bibliography, and conversion charts round out the book.<br \/><br \/>\"Southern Italian Desserts\" is a beautiful (and delicious!) homage to the varied desserts of southern Italy that make the most of seasonal fruits and local ingredients, along with ample holiday sweets and traditions. The many master recipes for items that would otherwise be expensive or hard to find means that anyone is able to recreate authentic Italian desserts at home; whether you're looking for a simple three-ingredient walnut cookie or an elegant layered tart, you're sure to find something that tickles your sweet tooth in \"Southern Italian Desserts!\"<br \/><br \/>(Review copy courtesy of Rosetta Costantino and publicist - grazie!)","images":[],"asin":"1607744023","parent_asin":"1607744023","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1385243306000,"helpful_vote":25,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4262,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"“There is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”","text":"Susie Fishbein’s bestselling series “Kosher By Design” goes out with a bang with the final ninth volume “Kosher By Design Brings It Home.” Inspired by Susie’s travels to France, Italy, Mexico, Israel, and North America, you’ll find kosher versions of favorites such as Korean short ribs, lasagna bolognaise, and shoyu tamago ramen (which normally has a pork-based broth here in Japan).<br \/><br \/>I have several kosher cookbooks that I cook from regularly (Including The Joy of Kosher and “The New Kosher”), but this was my first experience with the “Kosher By Design” series.<br \/><br \/>The menu leans most heavily towards Israeli and Italian dishes, including staples like arancini (fried stuffed risotto),  ravioli, Tuscan bean and farro soup, veal scallopini, brachiole, (fried) pizza Napolitana, ragu Napolitano, and lasagna, but you’ll also find Asian-inspired dishes (short ribs, spicy kim chee hangar steaks,  ramen, chicken adobo) and Latin flair in the form of chicken flautas, ceviche, and pulled beef tacos.<br \/><br \/>The salads and dairy \/ fish sections were particular favorites of mine. I love light, refreshing salads for nearly every meal, and the Israeli-inspired salads here are perfect for hot, hazy days when you don’t feel like spending hours at the stove. I loved the Provencal wheatberry salad, Lumina market salad, Carmel Spa pomegranate almond salad (I use pomegranate molasses as a salad dressing and was happy to see it in a recipe!), kale squash Caesar salad, root vegetable apple salad, and Chedva’s warm French potato salad was a revelation: baby potatoes, haricots verts, and a tangy white wine-herb dressing made this memorable (to make it dairy, you can add crumbled feta while warm).<br \/><br \/>Poultry includes rosemary lavender chicken, Amalfi sage chicken, and mustard caper chicken, and the meat dishes include various roasts, grills, and stews: pumpkin braised short ribs are perfect for fall, while the lamb cholent “cassoulet” reminded me of my trip to France’s Perigord in 2012. Dairy dishes include decadent bread pudding, farroto, pasta frittata, and risotto, while the fish dishes really shone: I loved the silan-glazed salmon (see photo) and the showstopping citrus-glazed salmon, layered with rows of perfectly symmetrical cucumber slices atop a citrus mayo. I also enjoyed trying my hand at the khachapuri shakshuka; having taught many students from Georgia, I’d long heard of the magic of khachapuri but had never tried making it before. Susie’s clear instructions (and the easy shakshuka topping; save the extra for omelettes and scrambled eggs!) make this a winner for breakfast or brunch.<br \/><br \/>Vegetarians have many options in the sides chapter, including a beautiful (and deceptively simple) eggplant and tomato tart (see photo), tershi and couscous (I’m a fan of all things pumpkin and had not heard \/ tried this amazing Libyan Jewish dish before), sweet potato wontons with teriyaki dipping sauce, chestnut tomato quinoa, and freekeh pilaf. Desserts are sure to tempt with a delightfully sweet\/tart lemon tiramisu, Beresheet Spa Kanafe, banana, date, and pecan cake, almond bobka ring, halvah baklava, and fudgy New Fishbein Brownies punched up with espresso powder.<br \/>Recipes are clearly labeled as meat, dairy or pareve (with some having multiple options depending on dairy-free substitutions) using color-coded icons. Note that some spellings use the Hebrew \/ Ashkenazi variations (chummos for hummus, seviche for ceviche, bobka for babka, etc.). I love that the font is a little larger and easily readable from several feet away as I tend to cook using a cookbook holder (and the ingredients are handily in bold). Each recipe comes with a full-page photo by John Uher showcasing each dish. The recipes (main dishes in particular) tend to be more elegant \/ upscale than some of my other kosher cookbooks (dishes like dried fruit and quinoa stuffed capons, turkey breast with hoisin tangerine glaze, and pumpkin braised short ribs would all make wonderful holiday centerpieces), but there are also plenty of recipes that come together quickly for weeknight meals (the eggplant and tomato tart, fish dishes, and veggie sides).<br \/><br \/>Overall, “Kosher by Design Brings It Home” is a wonderful finale to Susie’s best-selling series (with nearly 500,000 books sold) and a great way to taste the world from the comfort of your (kosher) kitchen; Susie’s headnotes introduce the reader to places and people she’s encountered on her fifteen-year culinary journey spanning several continents and multiple food traditions, from Italian nonnas to Yemenite family recipes passed down across generations. But at the end of the day, in Susie’s words, “there is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”<br \/><br \/>(Thank you to the Trina Kaye Organization for the review copy!)","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61jPKChASgL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61jPKChASgL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61jPKChASgL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/816atk1cNlL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/816atk1cNlL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/816atk1cNlL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81iBfukZZBL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81iBfukZZBL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81iBfukZZBL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1422616894","parent_asin":"1422616894","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1467235023000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4846,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Try the audible audio!  This is a wonderful \"listen\"","text":"Yes, it took me a month to listen to all 16.5 hours of this beautifully produced and cast audiobook, because I limited my listening to long car trips.  For once, flying through this engaging, mesmerizing story was not as good as putting it aside for a bit here and there and chewing over what I had heard.  \"The Lincoln Highway\" is an odyssey.  Emmett Watson is released early from Salina, a reformatory, because his father died and he needs to take care of his gifted, insightful, charming little brother Billy.  (Emmett inadvertently killed a bully in a fight.)  Their mother deserted the family years earlier. Their father, always a failing farmer had lost the farm. So the brothers decide to follow  postcards their mother addressed to them but never they never received.  They discovered these in their father's possessions, documenting her move to California along the Lincoln Highway when she fled Nebraska.  The brothers' decision plan to follow her path and try to find her goes awry when Duchess and Wooly appear.  They are friends of Emmett's from Salina and they have a plan that means they want to head East.  Neighbor Sally, friend\/classmate\/once a semi-girlfriend to Emmett, brings common sense and a burgeoning 1954 feminist sensibility to the mix.  One way or another, everyone ends up on the road. This is one of those books where you could repeatedly say, \"My favorite character is....\" \"The worst person in this book is...\"  \"I was\/was not rooting for...\"  \"That time when they stopped at X was so touching, scary, dangerous, funny, stupid.\" \"When X appeared on the train, at the circus, in the Empire State Building, I was gripped by the story within the story.\"  Just as Billy is hooked on each classic story found in Professor Abacus Abernathe's Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers, and Other Intrepid Travelers the reader is hooked on each episode that leads our heroes across the midwest to New York City and beyond.  Each is on a quest and each interaction with outsiders along the way has a ripple effect. They get separated and reunited.  We see particular experiences from each traveller's point of view. Some people are hurt by their choices.  Others are uplifted.  Saying too much about \"The Lincoln Highway\" would require spilling one spoiler after another.  There are stories of parents, families, individuals:  irresponsible, intentionally or unintentionally cruel, immoral, rich, poor, vagabond dead or gone, who inform and shape these boys and girl.  There are towns, cultures, traditions, ideologies and makeshift communities that enriched, spoiled, misled, enabled, ruined or stifled them.  What happens to each character makes sense, but is not always what we want for that person:  We love the sinners but not their sins.  Towles is an amazing, lyrical writer and a plain, clear storyteller As long as it took me to read that book, I did not want it to end and I felt cast adrift when it was over.","images":[],"asin":"B08WVLSDDR","parent_asin":"B08WVLSDDR","user_id":"AEZ26WGWJ3EOQ4KWSHG77HJAG4EA","timestamp":1639538581789,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2935,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Heartbreakingly profound account of the Wave","text":"I was stationed in Central Japan on March 11, 2011. At first we felt the 2.0 earthquake (we were in a prefecture where small earthquakes are extremely common) and laughed it off until we turned on the TV and sat in mesmerized horror at the brutality of the Wave. Many of my Japan Air Self-Defense Force wingmen were immediately mobilized for search and rescue and recovery efforts, including the monumental cleanup of Matsushima Air Base, which sustained heavy damage. The first week or so after Fukushima was  particularly nerve-wracking; we were constantly getting radiation updates on the TV, small aftershocks happened daily, and supplies started to disappear from grocery stores: first bottled water, then dairy products, then fresh produce. There was serious doubt whether TEPCO and the Japanese government were telling the truth about the scale of the meltdown and amount of radiation leaked.<br \/><br \/>When I had the opportunity to read \"Facing the Wave,\" it took me back to that time of grief and uncertainty, but also Japanese resilience. Haunting in the retelling, this was as difficult to read at times as those live Japanese TV images that will forever be burned into my memory: cars and bridges swept away, giant boats stacked like toys on top of what used to be houses, whole towns wiped off the map.<br \/><br \/>Ms. Ehrlich gives a much-needed human face and a voice to the tragedy. Told in very Zen, minimalist chapters, the book chronicles the stories of numerous Japanese who survived the tsunami from June - December 2011: everyday workers, fishermen, Buddhist abbots and nuns, elderly couples, people from all walks of life who struggle to find a new normal after they have lost their homes, possessions, and family members to the tsunami. There are months of living in crowded shelters, chronic food shortages, attempts to scrub and soak away radiation in Japanese baths, and a typhoon that dumps 17 inches of rain on an already flooded region... but as one elderly geisha relates, \"I lost many things, but I still have the words to the song.\"<br \/><br \/>The personal narratives are rounded out with snippets on the scientific background of the earthquake and tsunami, a much-needed clinical detachment in the face of so much suffering. Snippets of haiku and pertinent quotes are featured regularly. In keeping with the book's Zen aesthetics, there are no photos or illustrations other than a map of the Tohoku region highlighting many of the affected towns that the author visits during the course of her journey. There is also a very handy \"cast of characters\" listed in order of appearance at the end.<br \/><br \/>This was a profound read that captured the spirit of Japan that I know and love so well.","images":[],"asin":"0307907317","parent_asin":"0307907317","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1370134028000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2726,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Southern vampire goodness","text":"Sookie Stackhouse isn't your ordinary Louisiana waitress ... she's telepathic, but to the small-minded townsfolk, that's a disability that makes her \"crazy Sookie\" to most of the locals. In Harris's alternate universe, vampires \"came out of the coffin\" four years ago and are a common fixture in New Orleans, although not as common in Sookie's small town. Sookie's dying to actually meet one of the undead, but when a vampire does come to Merlotte's, she gets more than she bargained for.<br \/><br \/>Bill Compton lived through the Civil War before being turned into a vampire in 1870, a fact which endears him to Sookie's grandmother and her club Descendants of the Glorious Dead, where he discusses his acquaintance with various members' relatives during the Civil War.<br \/><br \/>However, Bill's life is jeopardized by vampire drainers, who make money by capturing vampires and selling their blood, which has druglike qualities. This either results in a two-decade painful recovery for the vamps, or death at the hands of the drainers. Bill is indebted to Sookie for saving him, and returns the favor more than once.<br \/><br \/>The town is rocked by a series of brutal killings of women who dated vampires (\"fang bangers\"), and Sookie and Bill race against the clock trying to find the murderer. Other complications arise, including Sookie's romantic involvement will Bill, her introduction into the brutal world of vampires, and her boss Sam showing a romantic interest in her (Sam's hiding a pretty big secret of his own).<br \/><br \/>Harris writes with a tongue-in-cheek humor drenched in Southern sweetness that has strong links to Southern Chick Lit a la Ya Ya Sisterhood. Sookie's Louisiana is peppered with Cajun expressions and flashes of antebellum grandeur. She creates a likeable protagonist who may not be book-schooled, but who is intelligent, down-to-earth and strong-willed. Sookie's gift of telepathy is gradually explored (and employed) in greater detail as the story progresses. Harris's breed of vampires draws on many common features of vampire lore (sleeping in the ground during daylight hours, death by sunlight or staking, allergy to silver, the ability to hypnotize), but in Bill she's created a fresh voice that has much more in common with humanity.<br \/><br \/>I greatly enjoyed Dead Until Dark, the first in a series of Southern Vampire Novels, and can't wait to see the HBO adaptation True Blood starring Anna Paquin as Sookie and Stephen Moyer as Bill. I look forward to reading the continuing adventures of Sookie and Bill in Harris's other Southern Vampire novels.

{"rating":5,"title":"from dry fruit and nuts (Shirini) lending sweetness to more pungent ginger","text":"As a longtime fan of Persian and Indian cuisines, I was intrigued when I saw my friend Marlene Spieler mention Niloufer Mavalvala's &#34;The Art of Parsi Cooking.&#34; Despite my familiarity with Persian and some regional Indian cuisines, I was not familiar with Parsi culture. The Parsi are followers of the Prophet Zarathushtra. The Parsi (from the word &#34;Pars,&#34; Iran), are Zoroastrians who migrated to India between the 8th to 10th centuries, and later their descendants who settled around the globe. Parsi cooking was largely shaped by Iran and India, and you'll find that both cultures feature prominently in Parsi dishes, from dry fruit and nuts (Shirini) lending sweetness to more pungent ginger, garlic, chilies and spices from India. The trinity of tikhu-khatu-mithu (spicy-sour-sweet) forms the underpinnings of Parsi cuisine.<br \/><br \/>The included dishes in &#34;The Art of Parsi Cooking&#34; are arranged by course, from appetizers such as scrambled eggs with spices and prawns in spices and beloved side dishes like eggs on potatoes, okra or tomatoes and fish with green chutney in banana leaves to main dishes like shrimp coconut curry and rice, chicken curry with vegetable palau, Sunday lamb roast, and chicken almond and yogurt curry. And of course, what meal is complete without a spot of dessert? You'll find the famous Parsi wedding dish of  Lagan nu Custard and almond and rice pudding to Parsi kulfi (burnt milk ice-cream with pistachio and almond) and ravo (semolina and egg pudding). Teatime snacks also offer a nice light pick-me-up, including butter biscuits, cake, and sweet pancakes. A discussion of spice blends is also included. Best of all, many of the spices and ingredients should be readily available in your local supermarket or Amazon (I've tried to cook from some &#34;authentic&#34; Indian cookbooks where I couldn't locate any of the regional veggies or obscure ingredients, so this is a huge relief!).<br \/><br \/>Each beautifully illustrated recipe comes with helpful tips, and I love that the book was printed with large, bold font for ingredients, making it easy to see and cook from. I loved the brown rice recipe; not to be confused with whole grain rice, this is basmati rice that gets its color from caramelized onions and is delicately spiced with cinnamon, cloves, peppercorn, and cardamom. The baked goods were also a fascinating and delicious departure from more syrupy, often-too-sweet Indian desserts such as gulab jamun; I loved the light, semolina-enhanced kumas and the delicately-spiced butter cookies.<br \/><br \/>As we move into fall and winter's chill, I look forward to cooking my way through more of these delicious, warming dishes that have sustained generations of Parsi cooks and families.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81l6IazANWL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81l6IazANWL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81l6IazANWL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1786290413","parent_asin":"1786290413","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1477355796000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2761,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Simple recipes for a long life, the Shoku-Iku way!","text":"Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori, Shoku Iku (“food education”) is a Japanese concept involving conscious eating: what we eat, how we prepare it, and how different foods are combined. Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori, shoku iku is based on the power of five: each meal should have five colors (green\/blue, red\/orange, white, black\/brown, yellow), tastes (sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami), senses, food groups and cooking methods (steam, simmer, broil, grill and fry, no-cook, sushi).<br \/><br \/>Makiko Sano’s new book “Healthy Japanese Cooking” (published in the UK as “Shoku Iku”) immediately caught my eye; having lived in Japan on multiple occasions, I have long been attracted to Japanese washoku (traditional cuisine) and shojin ryori (Buddhist vegan cuisine). Traditional Japanese meals are based on the freshest seasonal ingredients, engage all the senses, and if eaten properly and with mindfulness, should leave you satisfied but not stuffed (the Japanese concept of hara hachi bu, or eat until you are 80 percent full).<br \/><br \/>Beginning with the essential dashi (stock) and dressings (rosemary soy, sweet soy, sesame salad sprinkle, shabu shabu and others), there are very handy illustrations and step-by-step photos to instruct you on rolling sushi, julienning vegetables, etc. Dashi is the backbone of most Japanese soups \/ hot pots, and you'll find several variations here, including basic dashi (kelp + bonito flakes), vegetarian dashi (kelp and dried shiitake), Motoko's dashi (made with liquid from cooking brown rice; I had not seen this method in my other cookbooks!), and two soup stocks.<br \/><br \/>I found the chapter on steaming particularly helpful as I have not cooked fish via this method before, but you’ll find heavenly steamed sea bream, a posh cod dinner in 20 minutes, steamed chicken, stuffed veggies, pork dumplings, etc., most cooked in the microwave. However, a word of caution; these recipes were tested at 800 watts, and it would appear that American microwaves are more powerful in general (mine is 1.58 kW), so you may need to adjust cooking times.<br \/><br \/>Some of the steamed dishes are cooked on the stovetop; my new favorite discovery is the “Full Japanese” garden breakfast, full of leafy greens, tomatoes, mushrooms and eggs nestled into the greens. I also loved the vegan monk recipe for stuffed pumpkin and steamed sticky rice, which is full of carrots, shiitake, and mushrooms (you can leave out the chicken to make it vegan). And my favorite steamed custard chawanmushi also makes an appearance, as do perfect teatime snacks mochi, sweet potato treats, and fruit buns.<br \/><br \/>The fried chapter includes Japanese burgers and shrimp barbecue, but you’ll also find healthy low-fat vegetarian options like Japanese grilled vegetable “stir fry” (half grilled, half steamed), eggplant and shallot salad, “full of goodness” (with a liberal helping of my favorite Japanese vegetable, lotus root!), and chili tofu. The sushi chapter features an amazing brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi, temaki, sesame seed salmon sushi, brown rice tuna sushi with sweet-hot sauce, five senses super-tasty salmon sushi, and some new variations like wasabi cream cheese sushi with lamb, avocado and pear quinoa power sushi, and sushi canapes.<br \/><br \/>Ingredients are listed both in metric and US (volume). Beautiful full-color photos by Lisa Linder capture the aesthetic of Japanese cuisine, with beautiful tableware that offsets the featured dish perfectly.<br \/><br \/>The resulting dishes, all of which embrace the “shoku iku” philosophy, are light, nutritious, and provide plenty of variety of colors, flavors, and textures that are sure to brighten any meal. I found several new dishes that I plan on making frequently, including the egg and tofu dashi soup, rice noodles with mushroom broth, pan tai, iced tomatoes, brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi, and steamed sticky rice.<br \/><br \/>If you are new to Japanese cooking \/ flavors, then “Healthy Japanese Cooking” is the perfect introduction as it uses commonplace ingredients (you may have to order some of the more traditional ingredients like kombu and bonito flakes online), simple techniques, and is aligned much more closely with the traditional Japanese diet based on fish and vegetables than many Japanese cookbooks aimed at Western audiences.<br \/><br \/>(Thank you to Makiko Sano for the review copy!)","images":[],"asin":"1849496692","parent_asin":"1849496692","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1447541384000,"helpful_vote":22,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4447,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Beautifully photographed and lovingly written","text":"Food blogger and home cook Maryam Sinaiee takes readers through a full year in the Persian kitchen, including the festivals, traditions and rituals that make up day-to-day life across Iran.<br \/><br \/>Born in Tehran, Maryam learned to cook from her mother, grandmothers, and aunts. The kitchens of her youth were filled with the aromas of frying kotlet, stained glass jars of pickled fruits and vegetables, and sweets.  After relocating to the UK, she started her blog the Persian Fusion.<br \/><br \/>Iran is a large country, with many regional specialties. What we call Persian cuisine has been shaped by the Persian Empire’s ancient expansion, trade on the Silk Road, and the wide range of climates within Iran. Regional cooking in southern Iran has been influenced by Indian, Arab and African cuisines. The recipes in the book are taken from Gilan, Mazandaran, Azarbaijan, Kurdistan, Hormozgan, and Khuzestan.<br \/><br \/>Persian food is based on the theory of “hot” and “cold”: high-energy, high-protein foods are considered “hot” (no relation to spicy), while many vegetables and fruit (particularly sour ones) are “cold.” Persian meals are a careful balance of these elements; it’s believed that too much “hot” food can cause rashes and hot flashes, while too much “cold” food causes digestive issues and low energy. A meal may balance out each of these elements in the same dish; for example, walnuts are “hot” so they are served with pomegranate (“cold.”).<br \/><br \/>Like my country of Japan, Persian cuisine places great importance on seasonality and the first vegetables of the season, which are called “first of the harvest.” The Persian calendar is based around nature, beginning in March with Noruz (the spring equinox). Iran’s seasonal festivals (including harvest and rain) predate Islam by some 1,400 years. Persian cuisine places high priority on hospitality, and above all, beautiful presentation; dishes are garnished with saffron, yogurt, nuts, caramelized onions or herbs.<br \/><br \/>Beginning with spring, many seasonal fruits and veggies are incorporated, including rhubarb, onion and egg soup, lamb and rhubarb stew, fava bean and dill frittata, and rice with fava beans and dill (thankfully fresh fava beans, or “soramame,” are also a springtime staple here in Japan!). Summer finds lighter dishes using apricots, plums, cherries and mulberries, as well as chilled soups and cold salads, from the refreshing chilled yogurt and cucumber soup, rice with sour cherries, smoky eggplant dip, and zucchini with garlic, yogurt, and toasted rose petals to refreshing rosewater ice cream with pistachios and a melon and rosewater smoothie. Autumn is the season for quince, squash, pomegranates, pistachios and barberries. Heartier stews and dishes like duck in walnut sauce, lamb and dried plum steew, herbed meatballs and polos (pilavs) are rounded out with stuffed quinces, and butternut squash pancakes. Chilly winter features dried legumes, dried fruits, nuts and wheat noodles, like noodle soups, stews, hotpots, and hearty polos. The “Basics” chapter provides recipes for important elements like steamed rice, breads (taftun, barbari), salads, pickles, garnishes, and drinks.<br \/><br \/>The food photography (styled and shot by Maryam) is absolutely stunning, with beautifully plated and arranged dishes in an explosion of color and textures. The edges of the pages feature brilliant ceramic tiles and geometric designs, while black and white family photos and scenes from everyday life give a personal touch to the beautiful food photography. Recipes include both metric and US measurements, which I greatly appreciated as I prefer to cook by weight rather than volume, particularly when baking. There is also a glossary of Persian cooking terms.<br \/><br \/>I own numerous Persian cookbooks, and “From the Land of Nightingales and Roses” has quickly become one of my favorites due to the wide range of regional recipes, ease of finding most ingredients (I keep a fairly well stocked Persian pantry of barberries, spices, dried limes and dried herbs on hand), cultural tidbits, and beautiful photography – it is also highly accessible for vegetarians as many of the vegetable and rice dishes are vegetarian or can easily be made so. The flavor combinations are outstanding too: I loved the inclusion of currants and dates in the rice and green lentils with brown butter eggs, or the saffron potato frittata, which combines mashed potatoes, walnuts, cinnamon, and rose petals in a beautifully layered dish that also holds up well for leftovers (it reminded me of the Spanish potato omelette I used to eat as an exchange student in Spain).<br \/><br \/>Fans of Yotam Ottolenghi, Persian, and Middle Eastern cuisine will want to add this to your collection as soon as possible – it’s as close as you can get to a food tour of Iran (which is probably outside the realm of possibility for many readers).","images":[],"asin":"1623719674","parent_asin":"1623719674","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1547329444400,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4917,"length_group":3}

{"rating":5,"title":"Faithful adaptation of Worrisome Heart","text":"Melody Gardot's impressive jazz debut Worrisome Heart channels the retro piano jazz of Diana Krall and Holly Cole while remaining uniquely original. I loved the album, but wasn't sure how the sheet music would translate.<br \/><br \/>Published by Alfred Music, Worrisome Heart features nine of the ten album tracks (the album closer Goodnite was more of a sonic unwinding than a song) in the same sequence, beginning with Worrisome Heart. The song translates well to a piano-only medium, retaining its bluesy vibe (the piano picks up the bass part along with the piano melody). The acoustic guitar melody of All That I Need Is Love translates to the right-hand melody, while the Norah Jonesesque acoustic guitar of Sweet Memory is again picked up by the piano to impressive effect. The chilling cascade of notes opening Love Me Like A River Does is preserved, closing with the playful Goodnite. The left hand has some tricky rhythmic sections that mark time, so you may have to resort to a metronome to capture the exact timing that gives the songs their jazzy flavor.<br \/><br \/>Overall, the piano transcription retains all the original character of the recorded tracks, with the right hand picking up the various melody lines of the acoustic guitar. The piano-only versions are impressively complete (complete with clearly marked tempos and bluesy grace notes) and blissfully easy to master (I would rate this as intermediate). Lyrics and guitar tabs are also included (there are also violin and other solos marked on several songs). There's not a lot of artwork other than some black-and-white photos of Melody in the endpieces, putting the focus squarely on the music.","images":[],"asin":"0739057413","parent_asin":"0739057413","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1257511851000,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1670,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Talented new author with unique voice","text":"WHOA! This novel is an amazing coming of age story about dreams, values, love, family, organized religion, crime and figuring things out for yourself against many differing backdrops and options. The Ends is a neighborhood in Bristol, UK. The first thing you see after the table of contents is the Hughes family tree: Sayon is the son of Erica Hughes Stewart, who ditched her maiden name and family totally when she married a preacher and then later ditched her son because he did not measure up to his parents' rigid expectations.. The family is notorious, with many who can claim one or more jail stays and they are fiercely close and  protective of one another. Like much of the extended family, \"Say\" wound up living with Nanny, the Hughes matriarch. She will support every one of them no matter what they do. A very few members of the family moved on to become wage earners in the traditional sense. Say has a dream, going back to his childhood, of saving enough money to buy a large house with beautiful grounds that sits in not far from his rough and tumble home.  One of his earliest memories was walking there with his mother.<br \/><br \/>Say's best friend is his cousin Cuba, who the family calls Midnight because of his dark dark skin. Cuba is a year behind Say in school. Say excels in school and connects in his early years with Shona and Elia two girls who are also exceptional students. Shona's father Lyle is a preacher and Elia is Muslim. Cuba is always in trouble, does poorly in school and eventually quits, but he becomes a very successful drug lord. When we first meet Say, he is dealing drugs for Cuba,, trying to save money to buy his dream property. He has known Shona since elementary school. They are soulmates. Shona is making headway in the business side of the music industry. Elia has married Say's cousin Hakim and they run a popular bakery. He has a cousin Winnie, addicted to crack, who lives on the steps of Lyle's church, an uncle Michael, who has an intellectual disability, and maybe is dangerous, Uncles and older cousins who perpetually play cards in Nanny's back yard, a couple of three year old boys who are his cousin Jamaal's kids to two different women and the rest of the family who pop up continuously throughout the story, with back stories and expectations that those in the money will share and they do.<br \/><br \/>What is simultaneously amazing and difficult about McKenzie's writing is that much of the dialogue is laden with Jamaican and Somali patois, some that becomes clear in context and some that I could only guess at. Once I felt I'd figured out as much as I could, e.g. that \"Wagwan\" means, \"What's going on?\" and \"Enuh\" means \"you know\" and that the word, \"man\" is often used when someone is talking about him\/herself, I ran out of luck with a number of words that were used a lot. And, glory be: The Internet has them. One of my favorites was the phrase, \"He kissed his teeth,\" which I assumed was a tongue click or tch. Instead, it's a unique Jamaican way of expressing disapproval that's hard to describe or reproduce but can be found on Internet videos. Part hiss, part pursed lips, part little whistle. Since the same words unfamiliar to many readers are used frequently, I recommend looking them up early and you won't ever be distracted by them again, because the dialogue in this book is one of it's best features and instead of being stuck on the patois, it's easy to learn the words and read it fluidly.<br \/><br \/>As Say navigates through his world of good and evil, the prospect of losing Shona and confusion about what matters most, the story remains compelling, never boring. McKenzie was only 23 when this debut novel was published. I hope this means his gift will keep us up at night through many more characters, some extra new words in our lexicons and stories you want to follow and follow and follow. Highly, highly recommend.","images":[],"asin":"031642014X","parent_asin":"031642014X","user_id":"AEZ26WGWJ3EOQ4KWSHG77HJAG4EA","timestamp":1660787278312,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3906,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"An incredibly rich universe that holds terrifying secrets","text":"I first became interested in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy after seeing the film based on it ([[ASIN:B00005JPNY The Golden Compass (New Line Platinum Series Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)]]). I found the screenplay to be disjointed and lacking, so I decided to read the original novel in order to have a better idea of important missing background information.<br \/><br \/>Lyra Belacqua is a wild child growing up among stodgy scholars at Oxford's Jordan College. She's content sneaking around slinging mud, engaging in street fights with rival schools, and avoiding any real sort of education. Her daemon Pantalaimon is her voice of reason. And here is Pullman's first masterpiece: daemons are human souls that are present as an accompanying animal; they are connected to their owner, yet have distinct personalities. Generally, a daemon is the opposite gender of its human. Only children have daemons that are able to shapshift; once they reach puberty, their daemon will maintain that form.<br \/><br \/>Lyra and Pantalaimon witness an attempted murder that would have had devastating consequences for them both, and intervene. And so starts Lyra's journey to the North; to Svalbard, a reimagined Norway that's a dangerous land swarming with cliff-ghasts, ruthless Tatar tribes, and armored polar bears. Her secret weapon is an alethiometer, the titular \"Golden Compass\" that allows its user to ask a series of questions in order to discover the truth. There are very few in existence, and fewer still that know how to accurately read it. Lyra is one of those few.<br \/><br \/>Along the way, she becomes involved with the gyptians, a Gypsy-like seafaring tribe, a Texan balloon pilot, a friendly witch, and an exiled prince that aid her on her quest to reach her Uncle Asriel. Richly imagined and brimming with tantalizingly complex science, Pullman's universe is, much like Tolkien and Rowling's works, a self-contained universe that possesses its own form of religion (as many have noted, Pullman's works are anti-religion, or at least anti-organized religion), history, geography, and science.  The book is much more richly nuanced and imagined than the film adaptation, which does a dreadful disservice to the original novel by omitting the final chapters.<br \/><br \/>A note: if you consider yourself to be very religious, you may not want your children reading these books, as there are numerous anti-religious (specifically, anti-Catholic) sentiments within, as well as discussions of castration and scenes of at times extreme violence, including  towards children. Pullman, an atheist, takes issue with the dangers of organized religion; as one character puts it, \"Every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling.\" However, the His Dark Materials trilogy is beautifully written and imagined and has much to recommend it.","images":[],"asin":"0375838309","parent_asin":"0375838309","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1214046953000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2864,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"These stories are what headlines are made from.","text":"There are 3 short stories in this collection. These are what nightmares are made of. The first one is about Raena who lives under water and is treated so badly by her master, Orlish. It is her job as a special seamstress to her master and when one of her suits causes a tragedy, she is punished. The second one is about a haunted house that is abandoned after the family is tragically slain there. When Grace is asked out by the school hottie, Brandon, she just can't say no to him. Even when he suggests that they double date with his friend Greg and his girlfriend Elizabeth and want to visit the house, Grace has this feeling in her gut that they shouldn't go,but doesn't want Brandon to think she's afraid so they meet the other couple there. After they walk into the house,Grace is sure she should have followed her instincts to save her from the horror in the house !!! This is the nightmare one lol. The last one is more like a mystery when people end up missing in a small town, and then later found dead with no clues to who the murderer is. The local police calls in a professional profiler to help with the case. When the FBI, joins in on the investigation, they doubt her ability to be able to help because she is blind.

{"rating":5,"title":"Delicious, healthy  regional and restaurant Indian dishes in a flash!","text":"I’m so happy to share my friend Rinku Battacharya’s new book “Instant Indian”; it features 100 authentic recipes from around India, including dals, idli, curries, chaat, biryani, pulao, and more! There are also recipes for paneer, no-knead naan, yogurt, and spice blends.<br \/><br \/>I previously reviewed Rinku’s excellent “Spices and Seasons”; in recent months, I’ve jumped on the Instant Pot bandwagon and have found myself purchasing several Indian and international cookbooks designed specifically for the Instant Pot. Previously, I would avoid cooking dishes with dry beans due to the long soaking and cooking time required, but the Instant Pot handles most types of dried beans in 25 minutes or less, making it perfect for adding more protein and fiber into my diet (dried beans are also a very economical option).<br \/><br \/>Instant Indian is divided into 11 chapters, including regions, spices and kitchen basics, make-ahead basics (homemade paneer, masala paste, spice blends, and no-knead naan), breakfast and snacks (idlis, upma, dosas), rice and noodles, legumes and soups, vegetables and paneer, fish and shrimp, chicken and eggs, lamb and pork, desserts and drinks, and chutneys and raitas. You’ll find many restaurant favorites like alu gobi, tikka masala, butter chicken, saag paneer, and yogurt lassi.<br \/><br \/>For my review, I tested several recipes from different chapters including the tamatar masala anda, rajma with azuki beans, anda rassa, benarasi alu dum, and misthi pulao. I tested all recipes in a 3-qt. Instant Pot. The flavor of the misthi pulao was absolutely amazing due to sauteeing the spices in ghee first.<br \/><br \/>One suggestion I’ve found helpful is it’s well worth purchasing several additional accessories for your Instant Pot: at a minimum, buy extra seals (I find the color-coded ones particularly helpful) as smells tend to linger, if you cook curries often it’s worth having a seal just for those. My other suggestion is purchasing the clear glass lid for making yogurt. The hardboiled egg stand \/ silicone roasting rack by OXO is great too. And if you plan on making idlis, you’ll need to purchase an idli mold that will fit inside your Instant Pot.<br \/><br \/>Each recipe includes serving size, total time breakdown (this is important with the instant pot, as in addition to prep time you also have to factor in time for the pot to come to pressure, cooking time, and natural or manual pressure release), and whether each recipe is gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian (many of the vegetarian recipes can be made vegan by swapping coconut ghee or using firm tofu for paneer). As a huge fan of chutneys (which are difficult to find and expensive in Japan), I love making my own using Rinku’s recipes (at first I used her slow cooker version, now I love the sweet and tangy pineapple chutney from Instant Indian!).<br \/><br \/>The index is extremely user-friendly and thorough and not only includes recipes by ingredient, but also grouped by breakfast dishes, main dishes, etc.<br \/><br \/>There are numerous delicious ideas for sauteed and curried vegetable medleys using readily available vegetables and seasonings that will add color and nutrition to every meal, and enough variety to keep me happily cooking for months. Recipes are also labelled as vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free, making it super-convenient for those who follow those diets.<br \/><br \/>Whether you are a longtime fan of Indian cuisine or simply looking for new recipes to incorporate using your Instant Pot, “Instant Indian” is a fantastic resource that deserves a place in your kitchen!","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/8140oosp7WL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/8140oosp7WL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/8140oosp7WL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81wgZQ7ZbKL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81wgZQ7ZbKL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81wgZQ7ZbKL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81wi2RFEmwL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81wi2RFEmwL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81wi2RFEmwL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"0781813859","parent_asin":"0781813859","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1547065792743,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3604,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A big step up from the first volume","text":"I purchased my first slow cooker recently, and use it several times a week to make soups, breads, beans and whole grains. When I first started looking for slow cooker cookbooks, I checked out [[ASIN:1933615699 Slow Cooker Revolution]] from the library and was disappointed by the large number of recipes that called for lengthy prep both pre- and post-slow cooking, relied on canned\/processed shortcuts, and microwaving ingredients.<br \/><br \/>Enter the Slow Cooker Revolution Volume 2: All 200 recipes have 15 minutes or less of prep, making it easy to get your meal started quickly. Yes, there are still some recipes that call for microwaving veggies (and raw pasta!) prior to slow cooking, and you could also choose to do it on the stovetop if you have a slow cooker with a nonstick insert. However, most of the ingredient lists are much more manageable. Yes, there are still some recipes like the macaroni and cheese with broccoli and parmesan or the chicken pizzaiola that use condensed soup or jarred pasta sauce, but many more recipes appealed to me, like the cherry-sage or apricot ginger glazed chicken, vegetarian entrees, and especially the meals for two. I'm usually only cooking for one and end up with far too many leftovers, so it's nice to have options for smaller yields without having to do the math (I tried the poached salmon and it was so easy!). I also liked the fact that the slow cooker size is referenced; in the dips chapter, for those of us with larger slow cookers (5-7 quarts), you're instructed to bake your dip in a souffle dish; I use my [[ASIN:B0006TJ7FO Pillivuyt Porcelain 6-Cup, 6-1\/2-Inch Deep Classic Pleated Souffle Dish]] on top of a [[ASIN:B007QHYPFG Spice Ratchet Blossom Multi-Use Purple Flower Trivet]].<br \/><br \/>There's also a wide range of international influences, from Mediterranean whole grain salads and Provencal chicken to Tex-Mex, Asian, and Italian favorites, that will keep me cooking happily for many months to come. Like other America's Test Kitchen books, you'll find recommendations for various brands and equipment or helpful tips for each recipe.

{"rating":5,"title":"A beautifully crafted look at the horrors of WWI","text":"Although there are numerous young adult novels that deal with WWII, I've run across few that deal with the horrors of WWI in such intimate detail. Thirteen-year-old Annie's father is a doctor, and she's waiting for him at the train station when she sees wounded soldiers being unloaded from the train: victims of mustard gas, shrapnel wounds, and other war injuries. This reality brings the war home for her in a way that simply reading about it in the papers couldn't.<br \/><br \/>Soon, Annie begins to spend time with the wounded soldiers at the veteran's hospital where her father works.

I read this numerous times as a teenager, and recently purchased a copy in order to reacquaint myself with Annie's courage and the moving descriptions of patriotism and heroism.","images":[],"asin":"0064402487","parent_asin":"0064402487","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1205458219000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"length":1236,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Warm memories and sweet soul food","text":"Patty Pinner, author of the recent Sweety [[ASIN:1561588482 Sweety Pies: An Uncommon Collection of Womanish Observations, with Pie]], revisits the sweet desserts of her childhood in her first book Sweets, along with memories of growing up in Saginaw and of her family from Mississippi. The book is graced with vintage black-and-white snapshots of the author and her family (she has the most captivating, confident smile as a little girl) that illustrate the many down-home, Southern soul food staples: puddings, cobblers, pies, rich cakes, homemade candy, cookies, and ice cream. But the stories nearly upstage the desserts: tales of fanatically clean relatives, childhood birthday parties, the mysterious lives of grownups, and the lives of various family members intertwine with the comforting desserts of a Southern legacy (pecans, molasses, coconut and brown sugar all have starring roles).<br \/><br \/>Some of the more unusual offerings include a Dr. Pepper cake (there's Dr. Pepper in both the cake and the frosting; it adds moistness, similar to a Coca-Cola cake), a sweet potato cheesecake, a lemon rum cake, and recipes born from thrift, such as butter bean pie, mashed potato and bean fudges, and little of nothing pie (milk, sugar, flour, vanilla, butter and cinnamon).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are items that are probably sitting in your pantry or cabinets right now, so there's no reason not to give some of these wonderful heirloom recipes a try; why not sample some old-fashioned walnut-raisin pie, black walnut brittle, old-fashioned sweet potato pone, or a slice of walnut wonder cake? If you like homemade candy, there are many recipes for nut brittles (black walnut, cashew, peanut), peanut butter candy, and pralines. Ditto on homemade ice cream: you'll find soothing favorites such as banana, an intense lemon, peach, strawberry, and vanilla ice creams, along with some tantalizing sauces (rum sauce, caramel wine syrup).<br \/><br \/>Honestly, even if you never try a single recipe, this is a beautiful tribute to family, soul food, and a snapshot of Saginaw in the 1950s-60s. Pinner's writing style is engaging and friendly, and you'll find yourself happily crowded around her family's dinner table swapping gossip with her various female relatives as you try to decide which dessert to sample first.","images":[],"asin":"1580087981","parent_asin":"1580087981","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1222020347000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2322,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Sherlock meets a worthy opponent in the Phantom of the Opera","text":"In \"The Angel of the Opera,\" Sherlock Holmes is on one of his most challenging cases yet; the managers of the Paris Opera have hired him to reveal the identity of the Phantom of the Opera. As the novel opens, Sherlock and his cousin Henry are in Wales wrapping up a case that began in India with hired thugs, but are soon called to Paris when a mysterious \"Opera ghost\" starts making demands on the new managers.<br \/><br \/>The novel is narrated by Henry, whose presence is explained in order to fill the rift created when Watson killed off Holmes in an earlier novel. Henry, a doctor, describes both Sherlock's genius and his more human failings (melancholy, his none-too-handsome appearance) in ample detail. Henry and Sherlock must interview both the principal suspects Christine Daae, Carlotta, and the Vicomte de Chagny multiple times, as well as opera employees as they race to uncover the identity of the Phantom.<br \/><br \/>In many respects, Siciliano's novel is a brilliantly rewritten version of Leroux's original [[ASIN:0060809248 The Phantom of the Opera: The Original Novel]] that incorporates both the strengths of the original, as well as the observant sleuthing abilities of Holmes. Siciliano's descriptions bring the cast of characters vividly to life, and his language is suitable to the historical period of the novel, full of lush details of the opulence of that bygone era. His literary version of the Phantom in particular paints a man of great intelligence and musical genius who has turned into a twisted genius capable of death and destruction, but whose deep need for love and acceptance offer a glimmer of hope for the future (the ending was inspired and in-character for Siciliano's Phantom).<br \/><br \/>The story will be at once familiar for those who, like myself, are avid fans of the Phantom. This, along with [[ASIN:1933626046 Phantom]], was one of the first Phantom novelizations that I read, and remains one of my favorites. Even as someone who's never read any Sherlock Holmes novels (my familiarity of the character stems from cinematic portrayals by Basil Rathbone), \"Angel of the Opera\" is a fascinating hybrid that does justice to two literary giants.","images":[],"asin":"1883402468","parent_asin":"1883402468","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1207399493000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2191,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Another terrific book from Gladwell","text":"\"Outliers\", like other Gladwell books, is very enjoyable. It offers some interesting perspectives about what makes some people more successful than others, with particular emphasis on those who far exceed expectations. Many of the book's criticisms focus on what the book is not. I think that is a mistake. This is simply a fine book, a very thoughtful and easy read. The book goes into how one's ethnic roots and specific opportunities set the stage for dramatic success, then working hard takes over. For example:<br \/><br \/>1. An ancestral emphasis on community involvement can lead to health results which beat the odds.<br \/><br \/>2. The date of one's birth can affect athletic and academic success, as the oldest in a group of youth, will lead to the 'Matthew Effect', better coaching\/teaching, more games\/practice, etc. There is an accumulative advantage. On a list of the wealthiest people of all-time, besides opportunity showing up with so many from America, among that group, being born around 1835 and around 1955 stand out, to take advantage of when railroads and Wall Street emerged and when computer time-sharing emerged, respectively.<br \/><br \/>3. The 10,000 hour rule. Gladwell thinks about 10,000 hours of concentrating at a skill is necessary to excel at something.<br \/><br \/>4. Whether it is height in basketball or IQ, just being tall enough or intelligent enough is all that really matters, same with colleges as long as they are good enough. Practical intelligence, knowledge and savvy are what really counts and family background is the key to having those. Parents should be involved with their children, with lots of negotiating and expectations of child talk-back, necessary to cause a child to develop a sense of entitlement, maybe not the most moral approach, but extreme success madates that.<br \/><br \/>5. Jewish immigrants had advantage of occupational skills, like in the garment industry - enterpreneurial skills versus other immigrants like peasant farmers. Work was more meaningful. Their offspring saw this, plus NYC public schools were probably the best in the world at the time.<br \/><br \/>6. Harlan, Kentucky is an example of herdsmen settlers, with a culture of honor from Scotch-Irish ancestors, influenced descendants, Gladwell saying that crime in the South more influenced more by personal than economic reasons. Certain 'insult' words have bigger effect.<br \/><br \/>7. Plane crashes are more from human errors in teamwork and communication. Cultural respect for authority a big factor; can keep a subordinate from directing a superior in an emergency. Plus, 'mitigated speech' can be a problem. Can be remedied by training in 'Aviation English'.<br \/><br \/>8. Asians being better in Math, likely related to ancestral tradition of rice paddies, which are complicated and require hard work throughout the year. Western farming is more mechanical with usually an off-season with little work. Here again, more meaningful and hard work. Plus, Asians learn to count faster because of language differences for numbers.<br \/><br \/>9. K.I.P.P. Academy in the Bronx, charter middle school, is successful because it has long school days and short summer vacations, with students who commit to work hard. Studies have shown schools generally do well when they are in session, the problem are kids losing ground without good parental involvement during summer vacation. So, it is possible to make up for poor childhood family situations. Makes school meaningful. Incentives, rewards, fun and discipline is the formula.<br \/><br \/>A terrific book.","images":[],"asin":"0316017922","parent_asin":"0316017922","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1228340993000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"length":3581,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A surefire way to boost your spirits and count what's really important","text":"I have several autoimmune disorders. Unfortunately, chronic depression both runs in my family and is a symptom of one of my disorders, so I've struggled with depression on and off throughout my life. I do not, however, receive medication for my depression; instead, I manage it through exercise, a support group of family and friends, and positive thinking.<br \/><br \/>One of my tools is Attitudes of Gratitude by M.J. Ryan. It's a smallish book that focuses on keeping a gratitude journal; it's been medically proven that people who regularly count their blessings are less likely to be depressed.<br \/><br \/>Written in 1994, Attitudes of Gratitude is a sequel to the author's [[ASIN:157324855X A Grateful Heart: Daily Blessings for the Evening Meal from Buddha to the Beatles]]. Each of the sixty chapters is a meditation on gratitude and practical ways to practice and maintain thankfulness in our daily lives. The author recommends only reading one chapter a day in order to let the stories and messages sink in. According to Ryan, since gratitude is an attitude as well as a practice, we should take enough time to integrate her learnings so we can truly possess them.<br \/><br \/>Each of the individual chapters is opened by a quote on gratitude, and feature stories of various individuals who've overcome devastating medical diagnoses and divorces, personal obstacles, or other barriers to happiness. The readings are very brief (a page or two at most), so you have no reason not to be able to work one into a hectic day. Ideally, with practice you'll be able to take five or ten minutes for yourself to make a list of everything you're grateful for, from chocolate to loved ones to sunsets.<br \/><br \/>If the sound of all of this is making you uncomfortable with touchy-feely New Age overtones, the book is written in a friendly and accessible manner. It is spiritual rather than religious; there are no cutesy angels or cloying illustrations of puppies and kittens. In fact, there are no illustrations to allow you a clear view of the idea of recognizing and expressing gratitude.<br \/><br \/>This is a priceless gift for someone who is facing a rough spot, whether it's a recent medical diagnosis, a death in the family, or any event that temporarily robs someone of hope or joy. Attitudes of Gratitude showed me the power of positive thinking and expressing gratitude for what I DO have as opposed to what I think I'm missing or being deprived of, and has helped me to focus on the things I enjoy rather than what I'm not able to do or what I don't own.","images":[],"asin":"1573241490","parent_asin":"1573241490","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1205462934000,"helpful_vote":19,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2562,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"One of my favourite books!","text":"This is the kind of book I live for! I absolutely loved it. Give me a book about the sea, creatures of the deep with a supernatural or horror twist and you have me from hello. I have been craving a deep sea horror for a while and after reading a few of Peter Benchley’s books last year I had a big hole left to fill and then this book came along and it was spectacular!<br \/><br \/>There are so many characters and all are so well written that there is bound to be ones you like and ones that really get on your nerves. For me the main character Tory is kinda cardboard but there are so many other colourful characters throughout that the main character being distinctly blah didn’t really matter in the bigger plot. Diverstiy is key here with this many major characters all playing big parts in the overall story and even with the multiple view points throughout the book I never once felt like I got lost or confused by it.<br \/><br \/>The horror aspect of the book felt so real (even though you will keep reminding yourself these are mythical creatures) that you want to lock yourself in a safe place whislt reading and will most likely never be able to watch Disney’s The Little Mermaid again. These mermaids are like nothing you will have come across before and if you think you are safe as a woman because mermaid’s only lure men to their deaths, then this book will turn your fairytale world upsidedown. They do not discriminate! Meat is meat to them and they are scary as hell.<br \/><br \/>“In the picture, the creature—the mermaid— was facing away from the camera, pulling itself along the Atargatis deck with clawed hands. It’s tail was broad and flat, more like an eel’s than a dolphin’s and while the substance growing from its scalp could have passed for hair under the right light, it was clearly something else…”<br \/><br \/>A heads up for the non-science people that love a good horror, there is A LOT of science jargon in this book so parts of it may drag if that is not your thing. For me personally as a zoologist, the scientific detail blew my mind (especially the siren necropsy) and I couldn’t get enough of it. The author obviously did a huge amount of research when it came to this book as the detail was immacualte. If it had been another 400 pages about their findings after the voyage ended then I’d have happily have kept reading. I loved, loved, loved this book and would give it ten stars if I could.","images":[],"asin":"0316379409","parent_asin":"0316379409","user_id":"AEHWUHNTB5FX32HJ7UBOZ2WWUX3Q","timestamp":1600304028448,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"length":2426,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Excellent","text":"First off, I already respect the author, since he does appear to be one of the more reasoned voices during the last several years during this financial mess of recent years.<br \/><br \/>And after reading the book, I also conclude this book is well-reasoned and excellent for anyone who seeks to be better informed about what has happened and the risks which lie ahead.  Some of the things from the book which I think are noteworthy.....<br \/><br \/>1. Great Recession bad, but bottomed by 6\/2009 with 8.75M jobs lost and unemployment 10+%. By 2012, Occupy WS and youth have re-shaped lives, some good (save more\/spend less), some bad (less likely to seize opportunities or start new ventures even though the economy needs them).<br \/><br \/>2. Large businesses are doing well, WS is back and bank failures have abated. What policy makers did to stem the financial panic and combat the Great Recession (GR) remains controversial, but can be judged a success, including the auto bailout.<br \/><br \/>3. Obama blundered by saying unemployment wouldn't rise above 8% with the Recovery Act.<br \/><br \/>4. Government policy stopped deflation in housing, while being least effective with mortgage modifications and re-financing's.<br \/><br \/>5. Dodd\/Frank  not perfect but had some good things - didn't solve \"too big to fail,\" but makes failures more manageable like with stress tests.<br \/><br \/>6. The US outlook has never been brighter.<br \/><br \/>7. Only when the US gov't went all-in in acquiring stakes and debt of largest US financial institutions did the system's free-fall stop.<br \/><br \/>8. Unlike 2000, the Global Economy was using US financial institutions for investments\/savings - Treasuries first then mortgage-backed bonds. Securitizing of bonds and of mobile homes, credit card debt, no-down, no-doc  mortgages, etc resulted in regulators hurt by complexity of the system. Banks usually capitalized at 10xCash, but investment banks 30x and Fannie and Freddie 70x.<br \/><br \/>9. Fannie and Freddie were bit players -- mortgages dominated by the private sectors, but in 2008 concern triggered panic - Lehman should have been taken over, not permitted to fail. After bailouts, banks resumed lending to each other, FDIC ended silent runs by raising FDIC insurance. TARP made it all work. Also TAF, banks borrowing from the FED via silent auctions, creative loans to investment banks, PDCF, TSLF, QE's, etc all helped. However, ultimate judgment can't be made until the FED begins retreating from all the stimulating.<br \/><br \/>10. Emergency unemployment insurance is one of the largest economic multipliers.<br \/><br \/>11. Austerity made Europe worse. The US Recovery Act (ARRA) passed Feb 2009 GR ended in June. CBO said ARRA lowered jobless rate by 2%.<br \/><br \/>12. Should have been rapid principal markdowns on mortgages. FHA came to life, but offered loans as intended in 1930's. Temp. tax credits worked, stops buyers from waiting for prices to drop further.<br \/><br \/>13. Bankruptcy is OK for non-financial companies, but not for financial ones since they deteriorate quicker\/bank runs, etc. Fixing the financial plumbing - Dodd\/Frank not perfect, but helped - stress tests and identifying SIFI's sooner and  making sure they have enough capital and liquidity. Important to have large banks so the US remains competitive in the global economy. The US financial system, despite its risks, powers the most productive economy in the world. Financial crises are most difficult because they choke off credit - so, must restart credit ASAP to fuel a staggered economy.<br \/><br \/>So, an excellent book, especially welcomed because Mark Zandi, the author, I judge to be more open-minded than the typical economist.","images":[],"asin":"0137047983","parent_asin":"0137047983","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1357067795000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3721,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A stunning debut collection","text":"I have just finished &#34;Beasts and Children,&#34; and I sit here absolutely blown away.  I knew at the outset that this was a set of interconnected short stories, and I really enjoy this approach to fiction, a la &#34;Olive Kittredge.&#34;  However, halfway through the book, I was perplexed:  these stories did not seem to be interconnected at all.  They are well written, sure, but how did they fit together?<br \/><br \/>The reader's patience will be rewarded.  It is not until the final two stories that all the connections are made, to the great satisfaction of this reader.  Not that there is a happy ending, but there is a satisfying ending, and in life, that must often be enough, or more than enough.<br \/><br \/>The main characters in the stories are two sets of sisters, Carline and Cecilia (and their cousin Danny), and Jill and Mazie; these are rounded out by an immigrant family from Columbia and a boy named Jerry whom you will never forget.  The author shows us these characters at different points in their lives:  childhood, adolescence, early adulthood, marriage, parenthood.  These stories are not for the faint of heart.  They involve child abuse, parental neglect, animal cruelty, sexual aberration, and even torture of political prisoners--the list goes on.  How then, can I give such a book my highest recommendation?<br \/><br \/>In a word, writing.  I find it difficult to believe that this is the author's first book.  At first, you notice magical word choice or effective metaphor or characterization.  But the delights of the written word do not end there.  The piece de resistance, at least for me, is a stunning letter in the second last story from a mother to her unborn child.  I could not help but cry at its beauty and truth. Presented without an ounce of sentimentality, the letter will remain with you forever.  (However, if you read this book, don't skip ahead to this story.  You need the background in the preceding stories to experience the full impact.)<br \/><br \/>Thus, I recommend this book for anyone who wants to read about real people dealing with the tragedies life presents to us all, and then some.  You will be rewarded with some of the best writing you have ever read.","images":[],"asin":"0544370139","parent_asin":"0544370139","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1460923401000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"length":2217,"length_group":3}

{"rating":5,"title":"Peace and Parsnips","text":"Longtime vegan Lee Watson works as a vegan chef at a retreat center in Snowdonia National Park, Wales. In “Peace and Parsnips,” he collects 200 of his favorite recipes for smoothies, salads, nibbles, big plates, curries, burgers, desserts and more to prove that vegan food doesn’t have to be limited to spongy tofu and rubber-like nut cutlets. Inspired by his travels to Mexico, Turkish bazaars, Europe, Indian spice markets, and beyond, with minimal fuss and plenty of accessible ingredients he creates delicious meals that even carnivores will appreciate. With an emphasis on seasonality and mindful eating, you’ll find a well-rounded guide to the vegan pantry, including homemade nut milks (soy, cashew, almond, sprouted green lentil), spice blends, sauces and pestos, and even vegan feta that will allow you to create beautiful, healthful dishes that everyone can enjoy (in addition to being vegan, many of the recipes are also gluten-free).<br \/><br \/>Lee includes many international influences in his recipes from Latin America (tostadas with salsa verde, the Middle East (couscous, hummus, tabbouleh, mujaddara, falafel, muhammara), Europe (borscht, filo pie, eggplant involtini, pastas, tempeh chorizo), India (curries, koftas, pulao) and Asia (udon, lumpia, fried rice). You’ll also find a chapter devoted exclusively to “meaty” burgers from Portobello pecan to beet quarter-pounders, spinach bhaji burgers, chickpea, butternut, and apricot burgers, and puy lentil and walnut burgers.<br \/><br \/>The first recipe I tried was the kasha with rosemary, apricots, and walnuts. My Polish grandmother would frequently fix kasha when I was growing up; I have fond memories of the smell of kasha toasting in the pan before she would add mushrooms or turn it into pier&oacute;g lubelski (buckwheat pie in a pastry crust). I also love all things apricots and walnuts, so was interested to see how this flavor combination would work out. It was an incredibly satisfying combination of crunch (from the walnuts), toothsome buckwheat, and sweet notes from the apricots, plus it freezes well. This may be my new favorite way to serve kasha, and will definitely be going on my lunchtime rotation again soon!<br \/><br \/>The maple and orange-glazed tempeh with bok choy and soba noodles is another winner; I used green tea (matcha) soba as that is what I had on hand, and shimadofu (Okinawan tofu) as tofu is suggested as a possible variation. The beautifully citrus-infused tofu contrasts with the savory soy-based broth (I left out the cilantro as it is not commonly used with noodle dishes here in Japan).<br \/><br \/>I also loved Lee’s stuffed dishes, like the leek and wild mushroom-stuffed potato skins with lemon and chive yogurt, and his many ideas for millet. Although I regularly cook with whole grains, millet is new to me, and I loved the idea of using it as a filling for chard leaves (beet, millet, and raisin-stuffed ruby chard bundles with brazil nut and rosemary cream).<br \/><br \/>Here are two recipes to whet your appetite:<br \/><br \/>Pappardelle with Artichoke & Almond Sauce, Purple Kale & White Asparagus<br \/><br \/> This dish is a delight! So many shades of green, all bursting with flavor and nutrition. Artichokes make a surprisingly creamy pur&eacute;e. Throw a few almonds into the mix and you’re well on your way to deliciousness. In Spain, I buy fresh artichokes for pennies – pounds of the things are piled around our small kitchen and it can be difficult to know what to do with them. However, I recommend using high-quality jarred artichokes here. In this dish I tend to use white asparagus, but in autumn and winter I’d try to seek out some salsify.

Saut&eacute; for 1 minute, then add the garlic and continue cooking for 2 minutes more. Add the watercress leaves, cover the pan, remove from the heat and allow to cool.<br \/><br \/>Place the contents of the frying pan in a food processor with the artichokes, lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of olive oil, and blend to a smooth pur&eacute;e. The sauce should be thick and shiny. Add water to thin it out if necessary.<br \/><br \/>Heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed frying pan on medium and add the asparagus. Panfry for 6–8 minutes, until nicely caramelized. Add a glug of white wine, and when the liquid has evaporated, season and cover. Leave to sit.<br \/><br \/>Bring a big pan of salted water to a boil and cook your pasta for roughly 8 minutes, until al dente. Add the kale halfway through the cooking time. Drain well, keeping aside a little of the pasta water. Add the drained pasta and kale to the artichoke sauce and toss together, adding some of the pasta water if it is looking a bit dry.<br \/><br \/>Spoon into warm shallow bowls and top with criss-crosses of asparagus and a sprinkling of toasted almonds and parsley.

{"rating":5,"title":"The cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me - cow not included!","text":"I recently started making my own cheese with the \"[[ASIN:0761177485 One-Hour Cheese: Ricotta, Mozzarella, Ch&egrave;vre, Paneer--Even Burrata. Fresh and Simple Cheeses You Can Make in an Hour or Less!]]\", and was looking to expand my fledgling cheesemaking to cr&egrave;me fraiche and mascarpone...enter \"The Creamery Kitchen.\" My first exposure to \"The Creamery Kitchen\" came in the latest issue of the UK baking magazine \"Baking Heaven Savoury;\" I've discovered several great British cookbooks through the magazine, including [[ASIN:0297869388 The Pocket Bakery]].<br \/><br \/>Jenny Linford is a freelance food writer, a member of the Guild of Food Writers and author of fifteen books ranging from cookery books to ingredient guides. Her interest in food stems from living as a child in Singapore and Italy. In \"The Creamery Kitchen\" she gives both instructions how to make simple dairy products (butter, buttermilk, sour cream, cr&egrave;me fraiche, yogurt, labneh, cream cheese, cottage cheese, ricotta, mascarpone, feta-style cheese) and showcases simple recipes using those products (storebought works just fine if you're in a pinch). There is a brief introduction to \"Creating your creamery\" and ingredients, although I wish the author gave recommendations on substituting vegetarian rennet tablets for liquid rennet, which is what the recipes here call for (I purchased vegetarian rennet tablets in bulk when I bought One-Hour cheese).<br \/><br \/>Starting with simple yet delicious flavored butters (fennel, caramelized, piquant, fragrant spice, rose, and saffron butters), you'll find a chilled cucumber and mint soup with parmesan crisps that is perfect for a sweltering summer day, elegant beetroot latkes with smoked salmon and cr&egrave;me fraiche, asparagus, pea and labneh salad, not one but two variations of the classic Balkan burek, ricotta and spinach dumplings, cheesecakes, and even spaghetti with gorgonzola, pecan and mascarpone sauce. The recipes are straightforward and come together quickly with impressive results.<br \/><br \/>Most of the recipes are vegetarian with a few meat-based recipes (buttermilk fried chicken, lamb skewers, lamb and asparagus tacos with roasted tomato salsa). I loved the distinctly Middle Eastern flavor in the orange semolina cake and roasted red pepper, pomegranate and sumac raita, lamb skewers with za'atar labneh, and dukkah flatbreads with herbed labneh, and saffron and cardamom labneh with mango. There are also some Italian-inspired gems like the spaghetti with gorgonzola, pecan and mascarpone sauce and ricotta and spinach dumplings with cherry tomato sauce. Dairy-based desserts, including sour cream raisin pie, coeur a la cr&egrave;me with strawberries and passion fruit, yogurt gelato, whisky and raspberry cranachan cheesecakes, and fig and honey ricotta cheesecake, make up the majority of the offerings.<br \/><br \/>As with other Ryland Peters & Small titles, each recipe is lavishly photographed and layout is clear yet compact on matte pages. At certain points in the recipe \/ instructions, a cursive font is used that is a bit smaller than the regular sans serif font. Measurements are given in both metric and American measurements. British cooking terms\/ingredients give American equivalents when possible (clingfilm = plastic wrap, courgette = zucchini, single cream = light cream, etc.).<br \/><br \/>I tried the lemon thyme feta loaf and orange syrup semolina cake, which is basically a revani\/basbousa. The lemon thyme feta loaf was tremendously fragrant and moist from the olive oil and zucchini. My one recommendation is taste your feta first if using storebought as it can be tremendously salty. The recipe calls for 1 tsp salt as written, but I included both the salt and feta and found it was a bit too salty for my taste; next time I will cut back on or eliminate the salt entirely. I baked it in my [[ASIN:B0013K97PK Nordic Ware Lemon Loaf]] pan, which makes for a festive appearance (see photo). For the semolina cake, the cr&egrave;me fraiche took the place of the yogurt I normally use, and although the recipe yielded less syrup than I am accustomed to using, the finished cake turned out perfectly moist and froze well, making it a perfect teatime or breakfast snack.. I loved the chilled soups and simple and easy fresh veggie salads like the asparagus, pea and labneh salad and the broad bean, feta and dill salad; perfect when it's too hot to feel like heating up the oven.<br \/><br \/>Overall this is a great first book if you're new to making soft cheeses and dairy products at home; the instructions and recipes are simple and straightforward and most use ingredients that you should already have on hand (except for some of the Middle Eastern spices like sumac, za'atar, and cardamom and some basic cheesemaking supplies like rennet and cheesecloth). I loved the variety of dairy-based Mediterranean\/Balkan\/Middle Eastern dishes as this is my favorite cuisine, and I love that the preparation is manageable and the recipe yields are small (most main dishes serve 4-6). This is an excellent counterpart to One-Hour Cheese, which focuses on firm cheeses as opposed to creams and soft cheeses, and I will certainly find myself coming back to the \"Creamery Kitchen\" on a regular basis. If you are interested in learning to make your own cr&egrave;me fraiche, mascarpone, yogurt, cottage cheese, and feta, this is the book for you. And I concur with the reviewer who stated `\"...by the end of the book, I was ready to buy my own cow!\"<br \/><br \/>(Review copy courtesy of Ryland Peters & Small)","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61u8YOYpUwL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61u8YOYpUwL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61u8YOYpUwL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"1849754942","parent_asin":"1849754942","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1406589332000,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":false,"length":5582,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"1840s: Engrossing Story of Early Woman in Medicine and History of Medicine","text":"The Surgeon's Daughter is set in the mid-1840s in London, England and Bologna, Italy.  Eleanore \"Nora\" Beady was a small child when renowned English surgeon Horace Croft attended her family for a serious illness.  Her parents and siblings died and he took Nora to his home so she could recover.  She never left.  Dr. Croft and his housekeeper Mrs. Phipps, raised Nora.  Being a curmudgeonly nonconformist, when Nora turned out to be very bright and very curious, Dr. Croft raised her up to be a doctor herself.  But no medical school would admit women and when Nora participated in a surgery with Dr. Daniel Gibson, who worked for Dr. Croft, she was exposed and publicly shamed.  A mentor, Dr. Pera of the University of Bologna, surfaces and helps Nora be admitted to the medical school there.  While women are not treated as equals, they may at least become doctors in Italy.  Mrs. Phipps accompanies Nora to Italy, leaving the aging Dr. Croft and Daniel, now definitively Nora's love interest and almost fiancé, to carry on the practice.<br \/><br \/>Throughout, this book is engrossing for its description of the practice of medicine in general and surgery in particular in the mid-nineteenth century.  Nora has come from England with significant knowledge of the use of Ether as anesthesia, cutting edge for the times.  But while in Italy, she has the opportunity to participate in Caesarian sections, which are not countenanced in England.  (There went my perception that these were way more routine than they were for hundreds of years!)  We spend time all through the book in London, where Dr. Gibson runs the children's wards of a hospital, in addition to his private practice, often dealing with the tragic illnesses that endangered particularly the poor, but could strike everyone. Nora deals with intense bias and disapproval from her male peers and professors, but her brilliance cannot be denied as she proves herself consistently.<br \/><br \/>This would not be a realistic novel at all if there were not many heartbreaking deaths, illnesses and surgeries.  We get a wonderful sense of the cultural differences and personas of Italians and this Englishwoman.  The characters are very relatable, including those we root for, those we loathe and those we waffle over.  The story was genuinely a can't put it down (or in my case, couldn't stop listening to the audio version) and it had a very modern feel as Nora dealt with the challenges of being female in a male profession, the various surges in killer viruses and infighting among medical professionals.<br \/><br \/>This is an entertaining book and an easy read, while educating us on some issues and advances of the period.  It has lots of intrigue, romance, life lessons, near disasters and real disasters to move the story along but it leaves us with lots to think about the era.  I was surprised to learn that the author is two authors who used Audrey Blake as their nom de plume.  As usual, I can't say much more without spilling the beans on the plot and subplots, so read The Surgeon's Daughter, okay?<br \/><br \/>Also, as to the audio version of this book, the narrator, Susan Lyons, was terrific!  Spot on with her characters and tone and inflection.  Loved listening to her.","images":[],"asin":"B09XZ6223T","parent_asin":"B09XZ6223T","user_id":"AEZ26WGWJ3EOQ4KWSHG77HJAG4EA","timestamp":1653603642855,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"length":3244,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"The \"incredible edible egg\" in all its guises","text":"\"How to Boil an Egg\" is the follow-up to the lovely [[ASIN:0714844659 Breakfast, Lunch, Tea: The Many Little Meals of Rose Bakery]], the first collection of recipes from Rose Bakery. This latest installment is dedicated to turning the egg (\"nature's humble hero\") into breakfast, lunch, or tea. The title itself is tongue-in-cheek, as there is only a very brief one-page overview of various egg-cooking methods (boiled, poached, scrambled, fried, omelette) before launching into breakfast offerings (including standards such as eggs Benedict, Egg In the Middle and French toast along with delightful alternatives like Eggs Baked in Dashi and Scrambled Eggs with Tomato), scones and muffins, and pancakes, popovers, and oats. The various sections are full of quick, easy recipes that all star eggs in some form or another, whether it's a gratin studded with roasted veggies, lacy strips of eggs over veggies, curried (and other) egg salads, moist quick breads, or silky flans, puddings or custards (there's even a dairy-free soy crème caramel option).<br \/><br \/>I tried making the chocolate orange muffins in two different incarnations, one with low-fat sour cream and Splenda and one as written. I also added about ½ cup chopped candied orange peel to the batter, and it made a wonderful counterpoint to the chopped chocolate studded throughout. The sour cream results in a moist (but not wet) springy batter, while the chopped chocolate (and candied orange peel) added a nice contrast of texture. Note that the 6- 8 muffin yield seems to refer to panettone-style paper muffin cups like [[ASIN:B002JPJ0P0 Kitchen Supply Mini Panettone Paper Mold, Set of 25]], as I easily got 12 full-sized muffins out of my [[ASIN:B001IANICS USA Pans 12 Cup Cupcake\/Muffin Pan, Aluminized Steel with Americoat]].<br \/><br \/>The next recipe I tried was from the Lunch section; having lived in Japan, I am addicted to the delicate steamed egg custard known as chawanmushi and brought home a set of lovely blue chawanmushi cups. I was thrilled to see not one, but several chawanmushi recipes here, and chose the \"My Chawanmushi with Spring Vegetables.\" Most chawanmushi cups I've seen hold between 4 - 8 oz. of liquid. I filled four of my chawanmushi cups with the stock and veggies and still had an additional cup of custard left over, so you may want to try cutting the amount of stock in half. Also, the chawanmushi recipes call for tasting the raw custard for seasoning before steaming; I skipped that step. The resulting custards were wonderfully creamy and full of little morsels of spring goodness. **There appears to be a typo in the recipes for gratins on pages 60-61; the recipe intros mention using \"4 pretty cups or heatproof bowls and a steamer,\" but this actually refers to the chawanmushi recipes on pages 77-78. The rest of the gratin recipes reference baking the veggies and eggs in an ovensafe dish.**<br \/><br \/>Finally, I tried the Pumpkin Cake and the Semolina Custard from the Eggs for Tea chapter. I chose to make the pumpkin cake in the form of muffins, and the recipe yielded 20 standard muffins. The cake calls for olive oil, which loaned a fruity softness to the muffins, and the recipe calls for apple pie spice and cinnamon. **Note that the equivalent measurement for the pumpkin puree is not accurate; it calls for 2 cups pumpkin puree (with its original metric measurement of 425 grams); one can of pumpkin is exactly 425 grams, which yields about 1 ¾ cups. I felt like 2 cups of packed pumpkin, plus the 1 cup of olive oil and the ½ cup water, would result in too wet a batter, so you may want to go by the metric measurements if something seems a little off.**  I made the optional white chocolate drizzle and topped with toasted pumpkin seeds as pictured. The Semolina Custard comes with a lovely citrus glaze that is also fantastic as a marinade for tofu or chicken!<br \/><br \/>Overall, \"How to Boil an Egg\" contains more wonderful recipes from Rose perfectly suited for a light lunch or afternoon tea. Rather than use photos, the book is gorgeously illustrated with photorealistic watercolors by award-winning botanical artist Fiona Strickland. Most of the ingredients should be easy enough to find in your supermarket other than one or two exceptions like matcha, dashi, or purple corn powder, and the results were delicious and simple enough that I would make them on a regular basis. This is comfort food at its best, and fans of Rose Bakery will certainly want to add this to their cookbook collection.<br \/><br \/>(Review copy courtesy of Phaidon Press)","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61B9cHfo5KL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61B9cHfo5KL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61B9cHfo5KL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61IB23uGgFL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61IB23uGgFL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61IB23uGgFL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61Wf9MJto2L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61Wf9MJto2L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61Wf9MJto2L._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61y-wR0I3DL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61y-wR0I3DL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61y-wR0I3DL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"071486241X","parent_asin":"071486241X","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1365890946000,"helpful_vote":15,"verified_purchase":false,"length":4575,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Excellent step-by-step approach","text":"Excellent step-by-step approach in writing a screenplay. Things worth noting...<br \/><br \/>  1. Writing is a collaboration between the writer and the characters.<br \/><br \/>  2. Everything is visual or visible, dialogue is at a minimum.<br \/><br \/>  3. Pick a genre of film you like best.<br \/><br \/>  4. The story is the key, then the characters.<br \/><br \/>  5. The story should take place at the most crucial time in your main character's life. Put him\/her in lots of trouble, in constant challenge, so will be forced to change.<br \/><br \/>  6. Villains and demons move the story forward.<br \/><br \/>  7. Newspapers and magazines are excellent places to find ideas for stories.<br \/><br \/>  8. Good exercise:  This story is about ________ who wants _____. Then, who is it about - hero\/heroine, villain, buddy, and romantic interest.<br \/><br \/>  9. Never make the main characters too good, they should be the cause of everything and the plot is the effect.<br \/><br \/>  10. The main character always wants something and will do anything to get it.<br \/><br \/>  11. Character with major flaw must face up to it by the end.Imperfections make him\/her human. Stay away from cliches.<br \/><br \/>  12. The villain drives the story to catastrophe develop villain as much as hero\/heroine.<br \/><br \/>  13. Most critical conflict - the villain within. Villain controls 2\/3 of story. Imagine villain's point of view.<br \/><br \/>  14. Nothing progresses except through conflict.<br \/><br \/>  15. The buddy shares dreams, aspirations.<br \/><br \/>  16. Names should fit the conception of the characters.<br \/><br \/>  17. Photos\/pictures of what characters might look like. Age, height, weight, education,, music they might listen to,, description of their \"room to hide,\" job.<br \/><br \/>  18. Every scene reinforces main character's need, plus or minus.<br \/><br \/>  19. Create sympathy for main character.<br \/><br \/>  20. Don't divulge secrets until necessary.<br \/><br \/>  21. Underdog stories are good.<br \/><br \/>  22. Start the story at the last possible moment.<br \/><br \/>  23. How have characters changed, must establish need to change.<br \/><br \/>  24. Log Line - punchy 1 or 2 sentence description of the story.  Helps writer maintain focus.<br \/><br \/>  25. Three most important aspects of screenwriting - structure, structure, structure. Basic elements of structure:<br \/><br \/>  a. Basic idea, reduced to 1 or 2 sentences.<br \/><br \/>  b. Backstory - so viewer will know what the main story is about, snippets of dialogue not a lot of flashbacks, sprinkled throughout the story.<br \/><br \/>  c. Exposition - what the viewer needs to fully comprehend the , done dramatically not by dialogue unless by argument,conflict.<br \/><br \/>  d. Pace - escalates in intensity as the story progresses, shorter scenes, greater obstacles, more intense the revelations.<br \/><br \/>  e. Turning points, hurdles, climax\/resolution is last scene.<br \/><br \/>  26. 3 Act structure, 100-120 pages. Act 1 (1\/4) 1-30 pages. Inciting incident (p. 10-15), Plot point 1 ( p. 20-25) - the deciding point, hook which yanks story in the opposite direction. Act 2. (1\/2) p. 31-90. Midpoint (p. 60), Plot point 2 - point where main character says had enough, must resolve the problem. (p. 75-80) Act 3. (1\/4) p. 90-120, climax\/resolution - when main character's problems are resolved, doesn't have to be happy, but some kind of hope (p. 110-115). There is perpetual conflict.<br \/><br \/>27. Subplot - plot drives the action, subplot drives the theme\/relationships. Must intersect the main plot. Sometimes at the beginning and plays out before main action. Must have beginning, middle and end. There can be a hero and villain's subplot.<br \/><br \/>28. Break story down, a) Mini treatment - 3-5 pp in prose, will become the outline. 3 acts. b) Scene breakdown, acts 1,2,3 - 15,30,15, details of scenes on 3x5 cards, white, yellow,pink - only salient details, location, characters, issues, c) Expand each scene, more detail.<br \/><br \/>29. Scene - a) 1 shot or 3pp of dialogue, b) Start each scene with a context - every scene must have something to do with main character's need\/spine.<br \/><br \/>30. Simple plot, complex characters.<br \/><br \/>31. Begin each scene at last possible moment, each character has a goal in the scene, leave reader wondering at the end of each scene.<br \/><br \/>32. Sequence of scenes - connecting single idea -beginning, middle, end.<br \/><br \/>33. Dialogue - a function of the character, it develops gradually, don't worry if not perfect, 1\/2 way through characters begin speaking to you. Screenplay isn't about good dialogue, it's about good characters and good story., dialogue will come, rewrite. Dialogue  communicates info, moves story forward, reveals emotional stakes, reveals quirks, moods,, IQ, education, temperament, attitude, reveals conflicts between characters, creates tension.<br \/><br \/>34. Format the key a) No camera angles, you are the writer, b) Char into first time in Caps, full name, c) Don't number scenes until later drafts, d) Limit details e) Convey intention through essence and movement, f) Use strong nouns, active verbs, g) Music - if character can't hear it leave it out, h) No mention of where credits are, i) O.S. means off screen, V.O. means voice over, Fade Out on last page, script should be on 3 hole punched 81\/2x11 paper, one-sided.,<br \/><br \/>Also, the author includes one of his scripts, with notes. Overall, the book is excellent, and that it is a little dated only really affects the type of software, etc to use and related stuff.","images":[],"asin":"0767900715","parent_asin":"0767900715","user_id":"AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ","timestamp":1294766178000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":true,"length":5581,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"A healthy, colorful taste of Israel perfect for any level of home cook","text":"Winner of the 2013 Gourmand Award: Best First Cookbook and Best Cookbook Photography, the beautiful \"Cook in Israel: Home Cooking Inspiration\" will lead you on a colorful journey through (kosher) Israeli cuisine. Packed with delicious, easy to follow recipes, \"Cook in Israel\" draws on the author's Jewish-Greek heritage and the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean flavors of her Tel Aviv home. Orly has been offering popular cooking classes and culinary tours of Israel since 2009. \"The culinary tours are a way to introduce tourists visiting Israel, who are excited by the freshness of the vegetables and fruits here and create a way to bring visitors closer to our food,\" Orly explains.<br \/><br \/>Filled with 100 (mostly vegetarian) recipes, many with step-by-step photos, cooking from \"Cook in Isreal\" is like taking a personal class with Orly. Most of the recipes take 30 minutes or less to prepare, making them perfect for weeknight dinners. Recipes for Jewish holidays are included. A former clinical nutritionist, Orly's recipes are healthy, flavorful and easy to prepare. The recipes in the book reflect the way Orly's family cooks and eats and are inspired by her mother and grandmother, the local shuk (market) and by all the cultures that have come to Israel.<br \/><br \/>Given Orly's Greek \/ Sephardic heritage, it's not surprising to see many dishes with eggplant featured prominently (baba ghanoush, eggplant baladi, Turkish-style eggplant, roasted eggplant, Greek-style eggplant salad, eggplant with Bulgarian cheese, eggplant siniye, etc.). I really appreciated the many creative (and tasty) ways to use this versatile fruit (eggplant is technically a large berry).  I also loved the many refreshing salads (raw beet and apple, orange and fennel, cabbage and cranberry salad, carrot and pecan salad, parsley, nuts, and feta cheese salad) and the green shakshuka, which I had not seen before. The book's photography by Katherine Martinelli deserves special mention; all the photographs were shot in Orly's home.<br \/><br \/>I've made several of the recipes in \"Cook in Israel\" including several salads, a fish recipe, a sweet bread recipe and a cookie recipe. Each recipe is prefaced with a short history of a dish (or a food memory attached to it).  Although I love salmon, I'd never tried preparing it at home.  After making Orly's salmon baked with mustard and honey (only three ingredients - salmon, mustard and honey), I'm no longer intimidated by cooking fish at home and can't wait to try some of the other recipes like fish with green tahini sauce and the fish kebabs with yellow tahini yogurt sauce.<br \/><br \/>I also made the Bukharan chickpea pastry, and I loved her simple take on the Sephardic mainstay borekas using puff pastry dough (since these are already dairy, I prefer to use French puff pastry made with butter, such as Dufour, instead of Pepperidge Farm, which is pareve). I loved the dairy dishes like baked pasta for Shavuot.<br \/><br \/>I made the chocolate halvah babka and the date and walnut pinwheel cookies from the sweets chapter; the step-by-step photos were a huge help for figuring out how to cut and braid the babka (I'm used to making three-strand challahs, but trying to braid a two-strand rope was trickier!). The date and walnut cookies reminded me of ones my Iraqi students would bring to class; I loved the touch of rosewater and spices in the filling and dough.<br \/><br \/>Naturally, the biggest challenge (depending on your local supermarket) will be sourcing some of the ingredients such as date spread, date honey (silan), halvah, rosewater, etc. called for, but these are mostly found in the sweets chapter and can easily be located online. You can also make your own date spread at home by cooking pitted Medjool dates and a little water until it cooks down to a thick paste, which is what I did when I tried this recipe as I had a surplus of Medjool dates to use up!<br \/><br \/>One additional observation is that like some other Israeli cookbooks I've seen, the amount of a given ingredient may be up to the chef (a recipe will say \"diced olives,\" or \"chocolate spread\" with no recommended amount), or there are no detailed instructions for a given step (\"roast the eggplants under a broiler\" with no recommended temp\/ time), but most recipes include very simple instructions and uncomplicated ingredient lists that make these perfect for a quick weeknight dinner.<br \/><br \/>This is a wonderful introduction to vegetarian-friendly Sephardic and Israeli cuisine (the book is largely pescetarian \/ vegetarian with a couple of meat-based recipes); the recipes are appealing, full of fresh herbs and veggies, simple to put together, and there are plenty of tips and step-by-step photos that make \"Cook in Israel\" perfect for any level of chef.

There are detailed walking tours for the various neighborhoods, great maps, and many sidebars giving additional info on monuments, locations, etc. You'll find a detailed guide to shopping in Paris, including the expected fashion and parfum shops as well as housewares, crystal, souvenirs, and stationary.<br \/><br \/>There are also numerous lodging suggestions by location and price point, and suggested day trips out of Paris that include options many other books gloss over (the prerequisite Versailles, Chartres, Disneyland Paris and Giverny, as well as Auvers-sur-Oise, Fontainbleau, and Vaux Le Vicomte). The transportation section is also quite good, giving a solid overview of the metro\/RER trains, on foot, bicycle and boat. There's a very servicable guide to French phrases, a pull-out map, and a great metro guide inside the back cover. Of particular interest for families traveling with young children, you'll find many suggestions for kid-friendly dining and museum experiences.<br \/><br \/>This is a great (and compact!) guide to the City of Light, and I highly recommend it for planning your trip to Paris and environs.","images":[],"asin":"1118045971","parent_asin":"1118045971","user_id":"AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA","timestamp":1349445258000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1800,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Beginner to Mid-level Moodle User - Worth its value.","text":"Overall a good book to help Instructors, Faculty and new Instructional Technologist with limited to mid-level Moodle Knowledge.<br \/>Pictures are represent what you expect to see in Moodle from a faculty member's perspective to allow you to build your course and get it up online ready to go.<br \/>Chapter 1 - Developing an effective Online Course<br \/>  -- Provides some reasoning on why and how regarding Moodle and teaching. It could provide Instructional Designers a reference to provide faculty who are questioning the process and over all course design.<br \/><br \/>The book covers a wide variety of areas to assist the course development process and more importantly how you will then use the course to teach effectively to students. It doesn't get to far into the weeds so if you need that level of fidelity then this isn't the best book for you (Experienced Moodle users moving from 2.x to 3.x version).  Additionally, if you're experienced the beginning of each chapter on a bit of instructional design\/pedagogy  might put you off. I personally like the reminders as an Faculty Developer and Educational Technologist. Sometimes you just need to review the how and why to get better.<br \/><br \/>I like how the author has gotten into Workshops and Portfolios, two the least used modules I've seen implemented by faculty at 3 decent sized institutions. She provides explanations on why and how to use these sections to get most every one started and follow ups with examples on how to use them to further the learner's engagement<br \/><br \/>It's a good starter book for Moodle course design and implementation. Don't count on reading cover to cover in a day or so. But each chapter allows the reader the ability to jump to an area you need assistance with.","images":[],"asin":"178646229X","parent_asin":"178646229X","user_id":"AG35BKPUEUMX7LV5YLOQ5YCQ3GOA","timestamp":1466112440000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1762,"length_group":3}
{"rating":5,"title":"Riveting - Couldn't Put It Down","text":"I never have had any interest in horses or horseracing.  Still don't.  In spite of that I found this book so enjoyable that I couldn't put it down and read it very rapidly.  I saw the movie first, so maybe that helped?  Even if you didn't like the movie (I did), I do recommend you give the book a try.  It is (of course) much more detailed.  Some reviewers found it too detailed, but I thought the initimate details of the lives of the parties involved made this much more enjoyable than if it had been just a book about horseracing.  Some say the first section of the book is slow.  Perhaps so, but I found it interesting and enjoyable and a nice foundation to finally introducing the horse. Includes a fascinating look at the hard life of jockey's in the 30's & 40's.  Worth reading just for that.  Inspiring, emotional, heartwarming story that will have you in tears at times.  Hildebrand knows how to grab the reader and never let go.  Yes, it may be a little syrupy, preachy and overdone at times, but always enjoyable and never boring.  Not many writers could appeal to such a wide audience in a book that is supposedly about horseracing.  It is so much more than a \"horse\" book.  It is really about a team of unlikely people and animals who on their own were failures and worth very little, but as a team came together to produce one of the most enduring legends in American history.","images":[],"asin":"0449005615","parent_asin":"0449005615","user_id":"AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA","timestamp":1150227763000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"length":1391,"length_group":3}
